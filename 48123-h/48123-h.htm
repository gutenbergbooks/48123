  <h2 class='c000'>Preface.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>This volume is intended for those who find
it pleasant, at times, to wander in the
byways of topography and local literature. The
development of Lancashire, especially in its
relation to modern industrial life, has been told
by more than one able historian, and all that is
here attempted is to glean in the ample harvest
fields. The bygone customs, forgotten worthies,
outworn superstitions, historical episodes and
travellers’ tales here recorded, will, it is hoped,
not be without interest. If some of the articles
seem more modern than the title would strictly
justify, it must be remembered that the changes
in the condition of the County Palatine have
been so rapid that many things have become
obsolete in the life time of the existing generation.</p>

<p class='c004'>To several friends, and especially to the Rev.
Dr. Casartelli and Mr. C. W. Sutton, thanks are
due for various suggestions.</p>

The town of Manchester
was in a state of indignant
and feverish
excitement on the
17th of October, 1694,
being the sixth year of
the reign of William
the Deliverer. Everywhere groups of townspeople
were discussing the all-absorbing topic
of the “Lancashire Plot,” for on that day there
came to the town four of their Majesties’
judges, with every circumstance of pomp and
parade, to try for their lives gentlemen of the
best blood of Lancashire and Cheshire; unfortunate
prisoners who were accused of having
conspired against the Deliverer, of having been
guilty of the treason of remaining faithful to the
old King, whom the rest of the nation had cast off.
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>The prisoners were brought into town strongly
guarded, amidst the sympathetic demonstrations
of their neighbours, who were equally liberal of
groans and hisses for the wretched informers who
were about to do their endeavour to bring them
to the scaffold.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lancashire, which in the civil war struck some
hearty blows for the Parliament, was now a hotbed
of disaffection. The old cavalier families, in spite
of bitter experience of Stuart ingratitude, remained
faithful in spirit to the exile of St. Germains; and
the common people would have no love for King
William, who was a foreigner, nor for Queen
Mary, who sat upon the throne of her royal father,
whilst he wandered a weary exile in a foreign land.
The accused would have been pretty certain of
sympathy had the public mind been convinced of
the reality of the supposed conspiracy. How much
more so, then, when it was shrewdly suspected that
the charge had been trumped up by a gang of
villains eager for blood-money, and supported by
greater rogues anxious for a share of the estates
which would be forfeited upon the conviction of
their victims? Nor was the suspicion altogether
groundless; covetous eyes were fixed longingly
on these fine Lancashire acres, and the Roman
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>Catholic gentry ran great danger of being defrauded
of their inheritances.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1693, a commission sat at Warrington to
inquire into certain lands and property alleged
to have been given to “superstitious uses,” <i>i.e.</i>, to
ascertain whether the Roman Catholic gentry had
applied any portion of their estates or income to
the promotion of their faith, or the sustenance of
its ministers, and if they could be convicted of
this heinous crime the property was confiscated,
and one-third portion was to be the reward of the
undertakers. So confident were these persons
of their prey, that the plunder was prospectively
allotted. As the result of this commission, where
the defendants were not heard, the matter was
carried into the Exchequer Chamber. Here it
was pretended that at a meeting at the papal
nuncio’s house, Lord Molyneux, William Standish,
Thomas Eccleston, William Dicconson, Sir
Nicholas Sherborne, Sir W. Gerard, and Thomas
Gerard, had all promised money or lands for
Popish uses. But the accusers had been very
clumsy, for the falsehood of each separate item of
the accusation was so abundantly proved, that the
Government was forced to abandon all further
proceedings.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>When, therefore, in the next year, it was bruited
about that a plot had been discovered to bring
back King James and murder King William of
Orange; that men had been enlisted, commissions
received from St. Germains, arms bought and
concealed in the old halls of Lancashire and
Cheshire, and that those who had by the Warrington
inquiry been in danger of losing their broad
acres, were now also likely to lose their lives;
men said, not unnaturally, that it was a base and
horrible conspiracy against the Lancashire gentlemen;
that this was the next move in the iniquitous
game began at Warrington. If broken tapsters
and branded rogues were to be encouraged in
devoting to the traitor’s block gentlemen of rank
and estate, whose life was safe?</p>

<p class='c004'>Such was the state of feeling amongst the
crowds which surrounded the Sessions House,
opposite to where our present Exchange is
erected. It was not until the 20th that the
trial before a jury began. On that Saturday,
Sir Roland Stanley, Sir Thomas Clifton, William
Dicconson, Philip Langton, Esquires, and William
Blundell, Gent., were placed at the bar and, in
long verbose sentences, accused both in Latin
and English generally of being false traitors to
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>our Sovereign Lord and Lady, and specifically
of having accepted commissions for the raising
of an army from James II., late King of
England. After the case had been opened,
Sir William Williams, their Majesties’ counsel,
called, as first witness, John Lunt, who was
asked if he knew all the five men at the bar.
Lunt, with front of brass, answered that he did
know them all. Here Sir Roland Stanley cried
out, “Which is Sir Roland Stanley?” Whereupon,
to testify how intimately the informer was
acquainted with them, he pointed out Sir Thomas
Clifton! Great was the outcry in the court,
which did not lessen when the judge bid Lunt
take one of the officers’ white staves, and lay
it on the head of Sir Roland Stanley, and he
again indicated the wrong man. Being asked
which was Sir Thomas Clifton, he unhesitatingly
pointed out Sir Roland Stanley. Having thus
shown his accuracy, he was allowed to proceed
with his narrative of the plot. His evidence
asserted that in 1689 one Dr. Bromfield, a
Quaker, was sent by the Lancashire gentry to
the court at St. Germains, to request King
James to send them commissions, that they might
enlist men for his service. Bromfield, being
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>known as a Jacobite agent, it was determined to
employ some one less known, and Lunt was
pitched upon for the purpose. So, in company
with Mr. Threlfall, of Goosnargh, he came over
in a vessel which landed at Cockerham, that
famous village where the devil dare not come.
At the residence of Mr. Tildesley they separated,
Threlfall went into Yorkshire to distribute
commissions, and Lunt was summoned to attend
a midnight meeting of the Lancashire Jacobites,
held at the seat of Lord Molyneux, at Croxteth.
Here the persons now accused were present, and
many others, none of whom Lunt had ever seen
before. The commissions were delivered, the
health drunk of their Majesties over the water,
and some little additional treason talked. At this
point in the evidence Sir Roland Stanley remarked
how improbable it was that he should accept a
commission which might endanger his life and
estate from an utter stranger. “But,” cries Lunt,
“I brought you with your commission Dr.
Bromfield’s letter.” Then the judge said to
Sir Roland, “You are answered—that was his
credentials;” but did not think fit to say that
Lunt had made no mention in his depositions of
this circumstance, which was evidently invented
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>on the spur of the moment to confound Sir
Roland Stanley. The judge also observed there
was no great matter in Lunt not being able to
point out the prisoners correctly. Lunt, thus
encouraged by Sir Giles Eyre, proceeded with his
veracious narrative—swore that the Lancashire
gentlemen had given him money to enlist men
and buy arms; that he beat up sixty men in
London, who were quartered in different parts of
the County Palatine; and particularised some
persons to whom arms had been sent. In 1691
(about July or August), he was sent to France, to
acquaint the Pretender with what his friends had
been doing, and to inquire when they might
expect him in England. The spring following
was named as the happy time when the Stuarts
were to be re-established on the English throne.
He also named a meeting at Dukenhalgh, when
some more commissions were distributed by Mr.
Walmsley, one of the accused. Mr. Dicconson
now asked Lunt why he had not disclosed the
existence of this terrible plot, or why he had
revealed it at all. Lunt was evidently prepared
for this inquiry, and his retort was prompt and
crushing. Some proposals had been made to
which he could not assent. Being pressed by the
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>Court to be less reticent, and explain his meaning,
he said there was a design to murder King
William; that the Earl of Melfort (the Pretender’s
friend and minister) had asked him to aid in the
assassination; he had consented to do so, but a
Carthusian friar, to whom he had revealed it
under confession, told him it would be wilful
murder if King William were killed, except in
open battle, and he had revealed the plot lest his
old colleagues should carry out their wicked
project.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such, in brief, was the evidence of Lunt,
deviating often from the tenour of his previous
depositions, which had been made before he had
been under the moulding influences of Aaron
Smith, that unscrupulous Jacobite hunter, whose
duty it was to manage these little matters, to
procure witnesses and favourable juries. Favourable
judges were supplied by his betters. And to
fully understand the gravity of the prisoners’
position it should be recollected that they could
not have the assistance of counsel; their
witnesses could not be compelled to attend; they
were ignorant of the witnesses to be produced
against them; and, until they stood in the dock,
had not heard the indictment against them.
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>Every circumstance was in favour of the crown.
Lunt’s evidence was corroborated by Womball, a
carrier, and one Wilson, who had been branded for
roguery, as to the delivery of commissions and
arms. <em>Colonel</em> Uriah Brereton (a saddler’s
apprentice and common sharper) testified that he
had received money from Sir Roland Stanley for
the service of King James. This worthy Captain
Bobadil being asked if he was not poor and
necessitous when he received these gifts, cried
out, in true ruffler style, “Poor! That is a
question to degrade a gentleman.” The remaining
evidence we need not go into, save that of John
Knowles, who, having been sworn, declared “by
fair yea and nay, he knew nout on’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, after short speeches by Stanley and
Dicconson, the witnesses for the defence were
examined. The first half-dozen made some
damaging attacks upon the character of John
Lunt, representing him as a mean scoundrel, a
bigamist, and a notorious highwayman. Then
Lawrence Parsons, his brother-in-law, testified
that he had been invited by Lunt to aid him in
denouncing the Lancashire gentlemen, but had
refused the offer of 20s. per week and £150 at
the end, rather than “swear against his countrymen
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>that he knew nothing against.” Mr. Legh
Bankes, a gentleman of Gray’s Inn, told how
Taafe, an intimate friend of Lunt’s, and who was
expected to be a witness for the crown, had been
to the wife of Mr. Dicconson, and revealed to her
the whole design of Lunt, offering to introduce
some friend of the prisoner’s to Lunt, as persons
likely to be serviceable in any swearing that might
be needed to hang the prisoners. Mr. Bankes
was suspicious of this being a trap; but having
been introduced to Lunt, that worthy, over a glass
of ale, very frankly said that he wanted gentlemen
of reputation to back his own evidence, and if
Bankes would join he should be well provided
for. He produced his “narrative of the plot,”
and Taafe read aloud this manuscript, which
named several hundreds besides the prisoners.
“Why were these not taken up also?” inquired
Bankes. Lunt’s answer was, “We will do these
people’s business first, and when that hath given
us credit, we will run through the body of the
nation.” When the next witness arose, Lunt and
Aaron Smith must surely have trembled, for it
was their old friend Taafe, who, after adding his
testimony to Lunt’s villainous character, gave a
brief account of that worthy gentleman’s career as
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>a discoverer of plots. How the first one he
discovered (it was in Kent) came to nothing, as
he had failed to find corroborative evidence; and
how he was near failing again from the same
cause; how Aaron Smith had edited and
improved his original narrative. Lunt wanted
Taafe as a witness, complained that the men he
had hired to swear were blockish, and of such low
caste as to carry little weight. Could Taafe
introduce him to some gentleman—(God save the
mark!)—willing to perjure his soul, consign
innocent men to the scaffold, and receive blood-money
from Aaron Smith? Taafe, from some
motive not clear, determined to baulk the villany
of his fellow-informer, hence the circumstances
narrated by Mr. Legh Bankes, whose suspicions
of treachery had prevented a full discovery.
Taafe had partially opened his mind to the Rev.
Mr. Allenson, who had also distrusted him in a
similar manner. In Roger Dicconson, brother of
the prisoner, he found a bolder and more
adventurous spirit. The evidence of Mr. Allenson
need not be analysed. He was followed by Mr.
Roger Dicconson, who told how he was introduced
at a coffee-house in Fetter Lane, by Taafe to
Lunt, as a proper person to aid in the plan.
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>Dicconson called himself Howard, a member
of the Church of England, willing to join in the
plot for a valuable consideration. Lunt said they
had gold in for £100,000 a year, and that the
informants were to have a third of the forfeited
estates. He asked Lunt if he knew Dicconson’s
brother, and Lunt, all unconscious that he was
sitting face to face with him, replied, “Yes, very
well; for he had delivered commissions to Hugh
and Roger Dicconson about Christmas!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Many more witnesses were examined, some of
whom established that certain of the prisoners
were not in the neighbourhood of Croxteth and
Dukenhalgh at the time of the alleged Jacobite
meetings at those places; whilst others gave most
damaging evidence as to the utter rascality of
Lunt and his chief witnesses—Womball, Wilson,
and Brereton. The judge, in his summing up,
contented himself with saying that the matter
deserved great consideration, in which opinion the
jury did not agree, for, after a short consultation,
and without leaving court, they returned for each
prisoner a verdict of <span class='sc'>Not Guilty</span>. Mr. Justice
Eyres then discharged them, with an eulogy upon
the merciful and easy Government under which
they lived, and advised them to beware of ever
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>entering into plots and conspiracies against it.
Lord Molyneux, Sir William Gerard, and Bartholomew
Walmsley, Esq., were then put to the
bar, but, no witnesses appearing, they were also
declared Not Guilty, which gave Mr. Justice
Eyres an opportunity for another cynical speech,
concluding with these words: “Let me therefore
say to you, go and sin no more, lest a worse thing
befall you.” As they had just been pronounced
innocent, the meaning and fitness of his remarks
are somewhat questionable. But if his bias prejudiced
him against the prisoners, they would
have compensation in the popular satisfaction at
their acquittal. Manchester went mad with joy.
Lunt and his merry men were pelted out of the
town, and only escaped lynching by the intervention
of the prisoners’ friends; and all concerned
in the prosecution came in for a share of popular
hatred. The peril which the Lancashire gentlemen
thus strangely escaped was a very great one,
but the peril which the country escaped was
greater still, for had there been wanting the
disaffection of Taafe to his brother rascal Lunt,
the courage and address of Roger Dicconson, and
the honesty of the Manchester jury, England
might have seen a repetition of the atrocities of
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>Titus Oates and William Bedloe; might have seen
a bigamist highwayman going from shire to shire
and fattening on the blood and ruin of the best of
her nobles and gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such will be the impression left on most minds
by a candid examination of the proceedings at
this remarkable trial as recorded in the volume
edited by the Rt. Rev. Alexander Goss, <span class='fss'>D.D.</span>, for
the Chetham Society in 1864. It is only fair
to add that those who believe in the reality
of the “plot” may cite the resolution of the
House of Commons (many witnesses on the
subject were examined some months after this
trial), that there had been a dangerous plot, and
that the special assize at Manchester was justifiable.
That resolution strikes one as being more
political than judicial. A prosecution for perjury
against Lunt was abandoned, because it was
understood that persistence in it would bring on
the prosecutors the weight of the harsh penal
laws.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>De Quincey’s Highwayman.</h2>

<p class='c010'>“It was, in fact, the skeleton of an eminent robber, or perhaps of a
murderer.... It is singular enough that these earlier grounds of
suspicion against X. were not viewed as such by anybody until they
came to be combined with another and final ground. Then the
presumptions seemed conclusive. But by that time X. himself had
been executed for a robbery, and had been manufactured into a
skeleton by the famous surgeon Cruikshank, assisted by Mr. White
and other pupils.”—Thomas de Quincey’s <a id='auto' name='auto'></a>“Autobiographical Sketches,”
chap. xiv.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c003'>In “The House on the Marsh,” a novel that
has had a wide popularity in recent years,
the authoress, Miss Florence Warden, has chosen
for “hero” a highwayman, or rather burglar, who
lives in the style of a country squire, and, having
access to the “best houses,” manages to make his
position in society contributory to success in the
“profession” he has selected. There is a curious
parallel to the theme of this story in the life-history
of a man who was at one time an inhabitant of
Manchester, and whose strange career has already
furnished material to Thomas de Quincey and
Mrs. Gaskell. More than a century ago there
stood—and still stands—at Knutsford a house on
the heathside known as the Cann Office. The
tenant appeared to be a man of independent
fortune, kept horses, joined in the hunting sports
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>of the district, and obtained access to the houses
and tables of the neighbouring squires. According
to the tradition, he had one night noticed the diamonds
of Lady Warburton, and followed her
carriage on horse-back, but on coming up with it
was disconcerted to hear her say, “Good-night,
Mr. Higgins; why did you leave the ball so
early?” On another occasion he is said to have
noticed in Chester a ladder left accidentally against
the wall of a house in one of whose bedrooms he
noticed a light. Ascending, he saw a girl in her
ball dress take off her jewels, and place them on the
dressing-table. As soon as the maid withdrew and
the young lady was in bed, Higgins opened the
window, and, getting into the room, secured the
valuable plunder. A slight noise partially awoke
the sleeper, who said, “Oh, Mary, you know how
tired I am; can’t you put the things straight in
the morning?” and then fell asleep again. If
she had awakened and seen him he would
certainly have murdered her. Some suspicion
that Higgins was not altogether the plain country
squire he wished to be supposed may very well
have been excited by his occasional absences.
It is traditionally stated that his horse’s feet were
cased in woollen stockings for his nocturnal expeditions.
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>The murder of Mrs. Ruscombe, an old
gentlewoman, at Bristol, caused some noise. The
murderer was Higgins. Before the murder was
known at Knutsford, in his anxiety to establish an
<i>alibi</i>, he put in an appearance at an inn, and made
an incautious allusion to it which piqued one of
the company, a confirmed newsmonger, who
prided himself on having the first intelligence
of every event of interest. Suspicion was thus
cast upon Higgins. He was arrested at his own
residence, but managed to elude the constables,
and vanished from the neighbourhood of Knutsford.
He played the same <i>rôle</i> of country squire
a few months later at French Hay, near Bristol.
Thence he removed into Wales, “where he broke
open Lady Maud’s house at West Mead.” For
this he was tried at Carmarthen, and, notwithstanding
that he managed to have a forged respite
sent to the Sheriff, he was hanged at Carmarthen
on Saturday, 7th November, 1767. He died, we
are told, in a very sullen humour, but before he
was “turned off” delivered to the officials a letter
to the High Sheriff. From this document and
the contemporary accounts it appears that the
High Sheriff was acquainted with the birth and
parentage of Edward Higgins, about which no
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>details are given. His first exploit was that
of eloping from the house of his mother with a
neighbour’s wife. This was the beginning of
“all kinds of wickedness.” He was tried at
Worcester, 14th May, 1754, for housebreaking,
and was sentenced to transportation. “The
day before the transports were sent off from
Worcester, his sister came to him early in the
morning, and desired to speak with him in a
private room; this was refused. She then
requested that he might have permission to show
her the dungeon; thither they went, and stayed
some time in close conference. She had not
left the gaol more than half an hour when a farmer
who lived near Worcester came in to enquire
whether his sister had not been there, ‘for,’ says
he, ‘I have been robbed of £14, and I have
reason to suspect her, and that she has given
the money to her brother.’ The turnkey told
him what had passed. Higgins was searched,
but nothing was then found. He was brought
down to Bristol, put on board the <i>Frisby</i> for
Maryland, and delivered, with the other convicts,
at Annapolis. The farmer who lost the £14 (as
above) came with him from Worcester to Bristol,
and when Higgins was stripped on board the
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>transport the farmer’s money was found concealed
in the lining of Higgins’ hat; but as it could not
be taken from him, the farmer was obliged to
<em>be contented with the loss of it</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By breaking open a shop in Boston he obtained
a considerable sum of money, and escaped by a
ship sailing for England, to which he thus returned
within three months of his transportation. He
settled first in Manchester, and afterwards at
Knutsford, where he married at the parish church,
by special licence, Katherine Birtles, 21st April,
1757. In the licence he is styled yeoman, but in
the entries of the baptism of his children he is
called Edward Higgins, of Nether Knutsford,
gentleman. His fifth child was baptised 11th
June, 1764. His letter to the Sheriff concludes
with these words:—“As I die an unworthy
member of the Church of England, I do not
desire your prayers, as you will not receive this
till after my death; yet beg for God’s sake (as
you are a gentleman of benevolence) you will have
some compassion on my poor disconsolate widow
and fatherless infants, and as undoubtedly you
will often hear my widow upbraided with my past
misconduct, I also beg you will vindicate her to
all such as not being guilty or knowing of my
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>villany.” His wife remained with him until the
end. Higgins was dissected, and his skeleton
formed part of the museum of Dr. Charles White,
<span class='fss'>F.R.S.</span>, of Manchester. In his collection it was
seen by De Quincey, who has left a characteristic
account of the visit in his “Autobiographical
Sketches.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In De Quincey’s famous essay on “Murder as
One of the Fine Arts,” the professor of homicide
tells this grim story about Higgins. “At the time
of his execution for highway robbery I was
studying under Cruikshank; and the man’s figure
was so uncommonly fine that no money or exertion
was spared to get into possession of him with the
least possible delay. By the connivance of the
Under Sheriff he was cut down within the legal
time, and instantly put into a chaise-and-four, so
that when he reached Cruikshank’s, he was
positively not dead. Mr. ——, a young student at
that time, had the honour of giving him the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
de grace</span></i> and finishing the sentence of the law.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Gaskell wrote a sketch—“The Squire’s
Tale”—based on the career of Higgins, which
appeared in <cite>Household Words</cite>, and is reprinted in
her collected writings. When the Rev. Henry
Green was preparing his history of Knutsford he
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>carefully collected all the information that could
be found respecting the gentleman highwayman.
Edward Higgins deserves some remembrance not
only for the strangeness of his career, but for his
posthumous influence upon English literature.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Lancashire, it will be noticed, there has been a
marked tendency towards the diminution of reputed
centenarians. The general consent of mankind
seems to have fixed upon a hundred years as
almost the outside limit for the duration of human
life. The Hebrews and the Chinese are agreed
in this. The Celestials have a quaint way of
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>dividing a life into cycles. From birth to 10
years of age is the opening degree; at 20, youth
expired; 30, strength and marriage; 40, officially
apt; 50, error knowing; 60, cycle closing; 70,
rare bird of age; 80, rusty visage; 90, delayed;
100, age’s extremity. Far more claims to great
longevity are made than can be sustained by
reasonable evidence, and it should not be forgotten
that the burden of proof belongs to those who
make these statements. The bulk of mankind do
not exceed, and many of them never attain, the
Psalmist’s term of three score years and ten, and
it is only reasonable that those who claim for
themselves or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</span></i> an existence of five or six
score should be required to produce adequate
evidence in support of their allegations. Curiously
enough until the second half of the present
century statements of extreme old age appear to
have been accepted without doubt or inquiry. In
the census report of 1851 a sceptical note was
struck, and since then the late Sir G. C. Lewis
and Mr. W. J. Thoms—especially the latter—have
done useful service by a persistent demand
for evidence. Under investigation some cases
have proved to be impostures, and others mistakes
and self-deceptions.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>The historian of the county of Lancaster claims
for Ormskirk parish the prevalence of an unusual
degree of longevity. In the churchyard there are
gravestones over four venerable parishioners,
which record that the first of them died at the
advanced age of 94, the second at the age of 102,
the third at the age of 104, and the fourth at the
age of 106 years. Many centenarians, real or
supposed, have been connected with Lancashire,
and it is more than probable that a rigid investigation
at the time would greatly have reduced the
number. They are here presented in chronological
order, and have been derived from a variety of
sources:—</p>

<p class='c004'>1668.—Dr. Martin Lister, writing to the Royal
Society, says that John Sagar, of Burnley, died
about the year 1668, “and was of the age (as is
reported) of 112.”</p>

<p class='c004'>1700.—“Here resteth the bodie of James
Cockerell, the elder, of Bolton, who departed
this lyfe in the one hundredth and sixthe yeare of
his age, and was interred here the seventh day of
March, 1700” (Whittle’s “Bolton,” p. 429).</p>

<p class='c004'>1727.—In the diary of William Blundell, of
Crosby, under date 21st January, 1727, there is
this entry:—“I went to Leverp: and made Major
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>Broadnax a visit, he told me that in March next
he will be 108 years of Aige, he has his memory
perfectly well, and talks extreamly strongly and
heartally without any seeming decay of his
spirrits.” This, according to the Rev. T. E.
Gibson, was “Colonel Robert Broadneux, at one
time gentleman of the Bedchamber to Oliver
Cromwell, and afterwards Lieut.-Col. in the Army
of King William, died the following January, and
was buried in St. Nicholas’ churchyard, Liverpool,
where his memorial stone may still be seen.

to the diarist’s account, is one too many.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This Joseph Watson was born at Mossley
Common, Leigh, Lancashire, in 1649. Watson
was park-keeper to Mr. Peter Legh, of
Lyme. About 1710, in consequence of a wager
between his employer and Sir Roger Moston,
Mr. Watson drove twelve brace of red deer from
Lyme Park to Windsor Forest as a present for
Queen Anne. He was a man of low stature,
fresh complexion, and pleasant countenance.
“He believed he had drunk a gallon of malt
liquor a day, one day with another, for sixty years;
he drank plentifully the latter part of his life, but
no more than was agreeable to his constitution
and a comfort to himself.” In his 103rd year he
killed a buck in the hunting field. He was the
father of the Rev. Joseph Watson, D.D., rector
of St. Stephens, Wallbrook, London.</p>

<p class='c004'>1755.—Mr. Edward Stanley, of Preston, was

September, 1807).</p>

<p class='c004'>1808.—Mary Ralphson, died at Liverpool, 27th
June, 1808, aged 110. She was born January
1st, 1698, O.S., at Lochaber, in Scotland. Her
husband, Ralph Ralphson, was a private in the
Duke of Cumberland’s army. Following the
troops, she attended her husband in several
engagements in England and Scotland. At the
battle of Dettingen she equipped herself in the
uniform and accoutrements of a wounded dragoon
who fell by her side, and, mounting his charger,
regained the retreating army, in which she found
her husband, and returned with him to England.
In his after campaigns she closely followed him
like another “Mother Ross,” though perhaps with
less courage, and more discretion. In her late
years she was supported by some benevolent
ladies of Liverpool. A print of her was published
in April, 1807, when she was resident in Kent
Street, Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c004'>1808.—There is a print without date of “David
Stewart Salmon, aged 105, the legal Father of
two Indian Princes of the Wabee Tribe in
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>America. A resident of Cable Street, Liverpool.
After serving his King and Country upwards, of
sixty years six months and five days of which
time was spent without ever leaving his Majesty’s
Service, is now allowed 2s. 6d. per week from the
Parish of Liverpool. He is the last survivor of
the Crew of the <i>Centurion</i> when commanded by
Commodore Anson, with whom he sail’d round
the World.”</p>

<p class='c004'>1808.—Mr. Joe Rudd, writing from Wigan,
June 10th, 1808, forwards the following contribution
to Mr. Urban (<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, vol.
lxxviii., pt. ii., 576):—“I request you to record the
following narrative of the longevity of one family in
the town of Wigan, Lancashire, where Old Anne
Glave died in The Scholes a few years since at the
advanced age of 105. She was a woman well
skilled in herbs, and obtained her livelihood by
gathering them in their proper seasons. She
retained her faculties till the last, and followed
her trade of herb-gathering within a short time of
her death. Anne was the daughter of Barnard
Hartley, who lived 103 years, and lies buried in
Wigan churchyard. Anne had several children,
four of whom are now living at Wigan in good
health, viz., Anne, aged 91; Catherine, aged 82;
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>Sarah, 75; and Elizabeth, 72. Old Anne Glave
buried her husband, Robert, at the age of 84.
He was a fisherman, and famous for making
rhymes.” Jemina Wilkinson, Blackpool, aged
106. She retained her senses, and was able to
walk without assistance within a few hours of her
death.—(<cite>Athenæum</cite>, October, 1808).</p>

<p class='c004'>1809.—Mrs. Mary Leatherbarrow, of Hulme,
died at the age of 106.</p>

<p class='c004'>1817.—Catharine Prescott, who died in George
Leigh Street, June 2nd, at the reputed age of 108,
was a notable character in her day. It was said
of her that she learned to read—and that without
spectacles—partly at the Lancasterian School and
partly at Bennet Street School after she had
passed her hundredth year.</p>

<p class='c004'>1818.—Mary Harrison, who, in 1818, was living
at Bacup, was said to be 108 years old.</p>

<p class='c004'>1826.—Mrs. Sarah Richardson, a widow, who
resided at the Mount, Dickenson Street, died at
the reputed age of 101. She was a native of
Warrington, and her descendants numbered 153.</p>

<p class='c004'>1841.—John Pollitt, aged 52, and George
Pollitt, brothers, were interred at Rusholme Road
Cemetery, November 16th. They were followed
to the grave by their father, William Pollitt, of
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>Dyche Street, who had attained the age of 104,
accompanied by his great-great-grandson aged 21
years.</p>

<p class='c004'>1848.—An old woman living in Burn Street,
Chorlton-upon-Medlock, 110 years old, and in the
possession of all her faculties. She perfectly
recollected the coronation of George III., which
took place when she was 24 years old.</p>

<p class='c004'>1859.—Betty Roberts was said to be living in
Liverpool in 1859, and her birth was asserted to
have taken place at Northrop, in Flintshire, in
1749. Her son, aged 80, was living with her.</p>

<p class='c004'>1877.—In 1877 there appeared a notice of John
Hutton, who was born at Glasgow 18th August,
1777, and was apprenticed at Carlisle in 1793 as a
handloom weaver, but came to Manchester in
1796, where he served the remainder of his
apprenticeship, and was married in December,
1797, by Parson Brookes. He became an
employé of the firm of Thomas Hoyle and Son,
of Mayfield, and by his skill in mixing became of
considerable importance. In particular, he had a
secret for the preparation of China blue, which
was entrusted to his son, who died at a good age,
without having left a successor to the secret.
Messrs. Hoyle’s chemist, it is said, who knew all
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>about the theory of the dye, failed to get the
exact tint that was requisite, and a joking suggestion
was made to the old man that his services
were still in demand. He took the observation
seriously, proceeded to the dyehouse, where under
his directions the brew was a conspicuous success.
He was of medium size, cheerful temperament,
and habits of great regularity. He took little
interest in any matters outside the narrow limits
of his household and the works. He was not a
teetotaller, but was exceedingly sober and steady.
He completed his hundredth year 18th August,
1877. His senses were somewhat dulled, and the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcus senilis</span></i> was well marked. On his centenary
he was photographed in a group with his daughter,
grandson, great-grandson, and great-great-grandson.
His fellows of the Mayfield Works entertained
him at Worsley, and in a bath-chair he was
enabled to enjoy the gardens.</p>

<p class='c004'>1879.—Sarah Warburton, who died at Accrington
in 1879, was reputed to have been born
February 2nd, 1779. At the old folks’ tea-party
during the Christmas before her death she received
the prize of a new dress-piece for singing
a song of her juvenile days!</p>

<p class='c004'>1881.—The case of the “Crumpsall Centenarian”
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>excited some interest in 1881. She died
October 8th, 1881, and was reported to be in the
108th year of her age. Jane Pinkerton, whose
maiden name was Fleming, according to the
testimony of the entry in a family Bible, in which
the names of her brothers and sisters were also
entered, was born 16th June, 1774, within a few
miles of Paisley, in Scotland. When she was a
girl her father took his family to Ireland. She
married James Pinkerton, a schoolmaster in the
neighbourhood of Belfast, and at his death she
came to reside with a married daughter at Lower
Crumpsall. She is buried in the Wesleyan
Cemetery, Cheetham Hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>This list is not a complete one, and doubtless
many additions, some in quite recent years, might
be made to it. The reader will notice that with
few exceptions, amongst which is the remarkable
case of John Hutton—there is for the most part
an entire absence of evidence. The ages stated
have evidently been taken down from the statements
of the old men and women, with little or no
attempt to verify their correctness. It may be
useful to cite two cases that were adequately
investigated. The case of Miss Mary Billinge,
of Liverpool, is instructive as showing the
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>possibilities of error. She was said to have been
112 years old at the time of her death, 20th
December, 1863, and a certificate of baptism was
obtained which stated the birth of Mary Billinge,
daughter of William Billinge and Lydia his wife,
on the 24th May, 1751. It was known that she
had a brother named William and a sister named
Anne, who are buried at Everton. A reference
to the registers showed that these were entered as
the children of Charles and Margaret Billinge,
and a further search revealed the name of Mary,
born 6th November, 1772, and therefore only
a little over 91 at the time of her death. The
certificate relied upon to prove her centenarian
age was that of an earlier Mary Billinge.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other instance is that of Mrs. Martha
Gardner, who died at 85, Grove Street, Liverpool,
March 10th, 1881, at the age of 104. This will be
best given in the words of Mr. W. J. Thoms,
who, after the date of her death, says:—“Some
two or three years ago Dr. Diamond kindly
forwarded to me a photograph, taken shortly after
the completion of her hundredth year, by Mr.
Ferranti, of Liverpool. I afterwards received
from two different sources evidences as to the
birth of this very aged lady, whose father, a very
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>eminent Liverpool merchant, has duly recorded in
the family Bible the names, dates of birth, and
names of godfathers and godmothers of his fourteen
children, who were all baptised at home, but whose
baptisms are duly entered in the register of
baptisms of the Church of St. Peter, Liverpool.
Mrs. Gardner having a great objection to being
made the subject of newspaper notices or
comments, I advisedly refrained from bringing her
very exceptional age under the notice of your
readers during her lifetime. I may add that she
was a cousin of an early and valued contributor to
<cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, the Rev. John Wilson, formerly
president of Trinity College, Oxford, and on his
death on July 10th, 1873, Mrs. Gardner took out
letters of administration to his estate, and her
correspondence, she being then in her 97th year,
rather astonished the legal gentleman with whom
she had to confer on that business.”</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span></div>
  <h2 class='c000'>What was the First Book Printed in Manchester?</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>The answer to this question is not so obvious
as might at first be expected. There were
in the Lancashire of Elizabeth’s days two secret
presses. From one there issued a number of
Roman Catholic books. This was probably
located at Lostock, the seat of the Andertons.
The other was the wandering printing-press,
which gave birth to the attacks of Martin Marprelate
upon the Anglican Episcopate. This was
seized by the Earl of Derby in Newton Lane, near
Manchester. The printers thus apprehended were
examined at Lambeth, 15th February, 1588,
when Hodgkins and his assistants, Symms and
Tomlyn, confessed that they had printed part of a
book entitled, “More Work for the Cooper.”
“They had printed thereof about six a quire of one
side before they were apprehended.” The chief
controller of the press, Waldegrave, escaped.
In these poor persecuted printers we must
recognise the proto-typographers of Manchester.
No trace remains of “More Work for the Cooper.”
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>The sheets that fell into the hands of the
authorities do not appear to have been preserved.
Putting aside the claims of this anti-prelatical
treatise, we have to pass from the sixteenth to
the eighteenth century. Many tracts and
books by local men, and relating to local affairs,
were printed before 1719, but that appears to
be the date of the first book printed in Manchester.
The title page is here reproduced:—“Mathematical
Lectures; being the first and
second that were read to the Mathematical Society
at Manchester. By the late ingenious Mathematician
John Jackson. ‘Who can number the
sands of the Sea, the drops of Rain, and the days
of Eternity?’—Eccles. i., 2. ‘He that telleth the
number of the Stars and calleth them all by their
Names.’—Psalm cxlvii., 4. Manchester; printed
by Roger Adams in the Parsonage, and sold by
William Clayton, Bookseller, at the Conduit,
1719.” (Octavo.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The claims of Jackson’s “Lectures” were stated
by the present writer in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> (see
fourth series, iii., 97, and vii., 64), and in his
“Handbook to the Public Libraries of Manchester
and Salford.” Some further correspondence
appeared in <cite>Local Gleanings</cite> (vol. i., p. 54), and
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>an extract was given from one of William Ford’s
catalogues, which, if accurate, would show that
there was a local press at work in 1664. Ford
has catalogued a book in this fashion:—“A Guide
to Heaven from the Word; Good Counsel how
to close savingly with Christ; Serious Questions
for Morning and Evening; Rules for the due
observance of the Lord’s Day. Manchester,
printed at Smithy Door, 1664. 32mo.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Apparently nothing could be clearer or less
open to doubt. After a careful look out for the
book, a copy has been secured, and is now in the
Manchester Free Library. The title reads:—“A
Guide to Heaven from the Word. Good
counsel how to close savingly with Christ.
Serious Questions for Morning and Evening;
and rules for the due observation of the Lord’s
Day. John 5, 39. Search the Scriptures.
Manchester: Printed by T. Harper, Smithy
Door.” (32 mo, pp. 100.) There is no date, but
the name of Thomas Harper, printer, Smithy
Door, may be read in the “Manchester Directory”
for 1788, and the slightest examination of
the “Guide to Heaven” will show that its
typography belongs to that period. From
whence, then, did Ford get the date of 1664?
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>If we turn to the fly-leaf the mystery is explained,
for on it we read, “Imprimatur, J. Hall, <span class='fss'>R.P.D.</span>
Lond. a Sac. Domest. April 14 1664.” The
book, in fact, was first printed in London in 1664,
and Thomas Harper, when issuing it afresh,
reprinted the original imprimatur, which Ford
then misconstrued into the date of the Manchester
edition. The book is entered as Bamfield’s
“Guide to Heaven” in Clavell’s “Catalogue,”
and the publisher is there stated to be H. Brome.
Either Francis or Thomas Bamfield may have
been the author, but the former seems the
more likely. Thomas Bampfield—so the name
is usually spelled—was Speaker of Richard
Cromwell’s Parliament of 1658, and he was a
member of the Convention Parliament of 1660,
and was the author of some treatises in the
Sabbatarian controversy. Francis was a brother of
Thomas, and also of Sir John Bamfield, and was
educated at Wadham College, Oxford, where he
graduated <span class='fss'>M.A.</span> in 1638. He was ordained, but
was ejected from the Church in 1662, and died
minister of the Sabbatarian Church in Pinner’s
Hall. He wrote in favour of the observation of
the Saturday as the seventh day, and therefore
real Sabbath, and whilst preaching to his congregation
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>was arrested and imprisoned at Newgate,
where he died 16th February, 1683-4. His
earliest acknowledged writing was published in
1672, and relates to the Sabbath question.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first book printed in Manchester, so far as
the present evidence goes, was Jackson’s “Mathematical
Lectures,” but it was the fruit of the
second printing-press at work in the town.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Thomas Lurting: a Liverpool Worthy.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>Quakerism has a very extensive literature,
and is especially rich in books of
biography; which are not only of interest from a
theological point, but are valuable for the incidental
and sometimes unexpected light which they throw
upon the history and customs of the past. One
of the early Quaker autobiographies is that of
Thomas Lurting, a Liverpool worthy, who has
not hitherto been included by local writers in
the list of Lancashire notables.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thomas Lurting was born in 1629, and, in all
probability, at Liverpool. The name is by no
means a common one, but it is a well-known
Liverpool name, and many references to its
members will be found in Sir James Picton’s
“Memorials and Records.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> From 1580 to the
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>close of the seventeenth century they appear to
have been conspicuous citizens. John Lurting
was a councillor and “Merchant ’Praiser” in 1580.
A John Lurting was bailiff of the town in 1653;
but three years earlier had so little reverence for
civic dignity as to style one of the aldermen “a
cheating rogue.”</p>

<p class='c004'>From his own narrative we learn that in 1646, at
the age of fourteen, Thomas Lurting was “impressed,”
and served in the wars against the Irish,
Dutch, and Spaniards. He gives a graphic account
of the sea-fight at Santa Cruz in 1657, by our great
English admiral Blake, in which the Spaniards
came off second-best. At the time of his conversion
he was boatswain’s mate on the <i>Bristol</i>
frigate. There were two young men on board,
who had some conversation with a soldier who
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>had been present at a Quaker’s meeting in Scotland.
The soldier soon after left the ship; but
what he had said came back to the minds of the
young men, and presently they refused to listen
to the chaplain, or to take their hats off to the
captain, who added to his seafaring functions the
quality of a Baptist preacher. The chaplain
complimented Lurting as “an honest man and a
good Christian,” so long as, in his capacity of
boatswain’s mate, he persecuted the two youthful
Quakers. Great was the amazement when
Lurting joined himself to those despised children
of light. The chaplain and the captain in vain
tried to convince him of the errors of his new
theological associates. The Quakers increased,
until instead of two there were fourteen in the
ship. There was an epidemic of sickness, and
the Quakers were known by the care they took of
each other and their brotherly sympathy. When
he got well the captain allowed Lurting to have
his old cabin—which had the reputation of being
haunted—both for a sleeping room and for a
meeting-place.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this time the Quaker mariners did not
object to take their share of fighting, but when
going into an engagement at Barcelona, it came
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>into Lurting’s mind that it was unlawful to slay.
The Quakers having decided to “bear their
testimony” against war, had an unpleasant time.
Off Leghorn, in 1655, the preacher-captain drew
his sword to run one of them through.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thomas Lurting was several times impressed
after the Restoration of Charles II., but he
refused either to do the King’s work or eat the
King’s victual. On one of these occasions, after
five days’ fasting, he was put ashore.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the most remarkable incident in Lurting’s
life was one which occurred when, after he had
become a “harmless Christian,” he was mate of a
ship that was captured by an Algerine pirate.
The English sailors, following Lurting’s instructions,
managed to turn the tables and make the
Turks their prisoners; but, instead of selling the
pirates for slaves, as they had the opportunity to
do, they put them on shore not far from an
Algerine town. The pirates marvelled greatly at
this unexpected treatment, and the captives and
ex-captives took an affectionate farewell of each
other. Lurting’s account of this remarkable
transaction was written at Liverpool in 1680, and
was printed in George Fox’s “To the Great Turk
and his King, at Algiers.” Of this tract there is
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>a copy in the Midgley Library, at Manchester
(Vol. 16, Tract 7), and it is reprinted in the
“Doctrinal Books of George Fox” (London,
1706, p. 778). Lurting’s letter to the founder of
the Society of Friends is sufficiently curious to be
worth quoting in full:—</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>the 8th Month, 1663.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Dear Friend,</p>

<p class='c015'>Thine I have received: In Answer to thy request,
I have given thee an Account as well and as near as I
can; but as to the exact time I cannot, for I have not my
Books. I was George Pattison’s Mate, and coming from
Venice, being near a Spanish Island called May-York,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> we
were Chased by a Turkish Ship or Patah, as sometimes
before we had been, and thinking by our Vessels well
Sailing, might escape: But Providence Ordered it So,
That by carrying over-much Sail, some of our Materials
gave way, by which means the said Turk came up with us,
and commanded the Master on Board, who accordingly
went with four Men more, leaving me and three Men, and
a Boy on Board our Ship; and so soon as our Men came
on Board the Turk, they took them all out of the Boat,
and came about 14 Turks in our Boat. All which time I
was under a very great Exercise in Spirit, not so much for
my self, because I had a secret Hope of Relief; but a
great Stress lay upon me, for the Men in this very Juncture
of time; for all Hope of outward Appearance being then
gone; the Master being on board of the Turk, and four
more, and the Turks just coming on Board, I being as
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>one, even as if I were or were not, only desiring of the
Lord for Patience in such an Exercise, and going to the
Vessel-side, to see the Turks come in, the Word of Life,
run through me, Be not afraid, for all this thou shalt not
go to Algier. And I having formerly good Experience of
the Lords doing upon several such like Occasions, as in
times of War, I believed what the Lord did say in me:
At this all kind of Fear was taken from me, and I received
them as a Man might his Friend; and they were as Civil,
so shewing them all parts of the Vessel, and what she was
laden with withal, then I said to them that were our Men;
Be not afraid, for I believe for all this we shall not go to
Algier, but let me desire you, as you have been willing to
obey me, so be as willing to obey the Turks. For by our
so doing I saw we got over them, for when they saw our
great Diligence, it made them careless of us, I mean, in
securing of us; So when they had taken some small
Matter of what we were laden withal, some went on Board
their own Ship again, and some staid with us, which were
about Eight. Then began I to think of the Master and
the other Four, which were in the Turks ship; for as for
my self and the other with me, I had no fear at all; Nay,
I was far from it, That I said to one then, Were but the
Master on Board, and the rest, if there were twice so many
Turks, I should not fear them; So my earnest Desire was
to the Lord, That he would put it into their Hearts, to
send him on Board with the rest, and good was the Lord
in answering, for it was a Seal, to what he before spoke
through me. As soon as the Master was on Board with
the rest, all manner of Fear was off me, as to my going to
Algier, and some said to me, I was a strange Man, I was
afraid before I was taken, but now I was taken, I was not;
my answer was, I now believe I shall not go to Algier, and
if you will be ruled by me, I will act for your Delivery, as
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>well as my own. But as yet I saw no way made, for they
were all Arm’d, and we without Arms. Now we being
altogether, except the Master, I began to reason with
them, What if we should overcome the Turks, and go to
<a id='york' name='york'></a>May-York? At which they very much rejoyced; and one
said, I will Kill One or Two, another said, I will cut as
many of their Throats, as you will have me; this was our
Mens Answer. At which I was much troubled, and said
unto them, If I knew any of them that offered to touch a
Turk, I would tell the Turks my self. But said to them;
If you will be rul’d, I will act for you, if not, I will be
still; to which they agreed to do, what I would have them.
Then said I, if the Turks bid you do any thing, do it
without grumbling, and with as much Diligence and
Quickness as you can, for I see that pleases them, and
that will cause them to let us be together: To which they
agreed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then I went to the Master, who was a Man of a very
bold Spirit, and told him our Intents; whose answer to
me was, If we offered to rise, and they overcame us, we
had as good be burnt alive, the which I knew very well.
But I could get him no way to adhere to me, in that he
being fearful of Blood-shed; for that was his Reason:
Insomuch, that at last I told him we were resolved, and I
question’d not to do it without one Drop of Blood spilt,
and I believ’d that the Lord would prosper it, by Reason,
I could rather go to Algier, than to kill a Turk: So at last
he agreed to this, to let me do what I would, provided we
killed none: At that time there being still two Turks lying
in the Cabin with him: So that he was to lie in the Cabin,
that by his being there they should mistrust nothing, which
accordingly he did. And having bad weather, and lost
the Company of the Man of War; the Turks seeing our
Diligence, made them careless of us.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>So the second Night, after the Captain was gone to
sleep, I perswaded one to lie in my Cabin, and so one in
another, till at last it raining very much, I perswaded them
all down to sleep; and when asleep, got their Arms in
Possession. Then said I to the Men of our Vessel: Now
have we the Turks at our Command; no Man shall hurt
any of them, for if you do, I will be against you: But
this we will do, now they are under, we will keep them so,
and go to May-York. So when I had ordered some to
keep the Doors, if any should come out, straightly charging
the Spilling of no Blood; and so altered our Course for
May-York the which in the Morning we were fair by: So
my Order was to our Men, if any offer’d to come out, not
to let out above one at a time. And in the Morning one
came out, expecting to have seen their own Country, but
on the contrary, it was May-York. Now, said I to our
Men, be careful of the Door, for when he goes in, we shall
see what they will do. And as soon as he told them we
were going towards May-York, they instead of Rising, fell
all to crying, for their Hearts were taken from them. So
they desired they might not be Sold; the which I promised
they should not. So soon as I had pacified them, then I
went in to the Master, he not yet knowing what was done,
and so he told their Captain what we had done, how that
we had over-come his Men, and that we were going for
May-York. At which unexpected News he Wept, and
desired the Master not to Sell him; the which he promised
he would not. Then we told the Captain we would make
a Place to hide them in, where the Spaniards should not
find them; at which they were very glad, and we did
accordingly. So when we came in, the Master went on
Shoar, with Four more, and left me on Board with the
Turks, which were Ten. And when he had done his
Business, not taking Product, lest the Spaniards should
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>come and see the Turks. But at Night an English Master
came on Board, being an Acquaintance; and after some
Discourse, we told him if he would not betray us, we
would tell him what we had done; but we would not have
the Spaniards to know it, lest they should take them from
us; The which he promis’d, but broke it; and would fain
have had Two or Three of them, to have brought them
for England; but we saw his end; And when he saw he
could not prevail, he said they were worth Two or Three
Hundred Pieces of Eight a Piece; Whereat, both the
Master and I told him, if they would give many Thousands
they should not have One, for we hoped to send them
home again. So he look’d upon us as Fools, because we
would not Sell them; the which I would not have done
for the whole Island. But contrary to our Expectations,
he told the Spaniards, who threatned to take them from
us: But so soon as we heard thereof, we called out all the
Turks, and told them they must help us, or the Spaniards
would take them from us. So they resolvedly helped us,
and we made all haste to run from the Spaniards, the
which pleased the Turks very well. So we put our selves
to the Hazard of the Turks, and being taken again, to
save them.</p>

<p class='c015'>So we continued about six or seven days, not being
willing to put into any Port of Spain, for fear of losing the
Turks. We let them have all their liberty for four days,
till they made an attempt to rise, the which I foresaw, and
prevented without any harm. I was very Courteous to
them, at the which some of our men grumbled, saying, I
had more care of the Turks than them; My Answer was,
They are Strangers, I must treat them well. At last, I
told the Master it might do well to go to the Turks Coast,
for there it was more likely to miss their Men of War than
where we were; and also it might fall out so, that we
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>might have an Opportunity to put the Turks on Shoar:
To which the Master agreed. And in two days we were
near the Turks Shoar, at a place called Cape Hone, about
Fifty Miles from Algier, as the Turks told us. So when
we came about six Miles from the Shore it fell calm, and
I had very much working in my mind, about getting them
ashore.</p>

<p class='c015'>At last I went to the Master, and told him, I had a
great desire to put the Turks on Shore, but how I knew
not; for to give them the Boat, they might go and get
Men and Arms, and so take us again; and to put half on
Shoar, they would raise the Country and surprize us when
we came with the rest. But if he would let me go, and if
three more would go with me, I would venture to put
them on Shoar; to which he consented.</p>

<p class='c015'>So then I spoke to the men, and there were two more,
and my self and a Boy took in the ten Turks all loose,
and went about six miles and put them on Shore in their
own Country, within about four miles of Two Towns
which they knew. Withal, we gave them about fifty Padas
of Bread and other Necessaries to Travel with. They
would fain have enticed us to go to the Towns, telling us
we should have Wines, and many other things: As to
their parts, I could have ventured with them. They all
embraced me very kindly in their Arms when they went
ashore. They made one Rising in the Boat when going
ashore, the which I prevented; and we parted with a great
deal of love.</p>

<p class='c015'>When we came home to England, the King came to the
Vessels side, and enquired an Account, the which the
Master gave him. So this is as near as I can certifie thee;
I have writ thee more at large to give thee the whole as it
was; but thou mayst take what is the most material, and
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>so I rest thine in that which can do good for evil, which
ought to be the practice of all true men.</p>

<p class='c015'>Liverpoole, the 30th of the fifth Month, 1680.</p>

<div class='c016'><span class='sc'>Thomas Lurting.</span>”</div>

<p class='c004'>After a stormy manhood Thomas Lurting had
a peaceful old age. Part of his well-earned
leisure was devoted to the preparation of an
autobiography, which appeared in 1710, with the
following quaint title:—“The Fighting Sailor
turned <a id='peace' name='peace'></a>peaceable Christian; manifested in the
convincement and conversion of Thomas Lurting.
With a short relation of many great Dangers, and
wonderful <a id='ance' name='ance'></a>Deliverances, he met withal. First
written for private satisfaction, and now published
for general service.” This tract, sometimes in an
abridged form, has been several times reprinted,
and there were editions in 1711, 1720, no date,
1766, 1801 (Leeds), 1811, 1813, 1820, and
1842.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thomas Lurting died 30th First Month, 1713.
His corpse was taken to the Friends’ Meeting
House at Horsleydown, Southwark, where a
funeral sermon was preached on the occasion.
The body was then interred at the Friends’
Burial-ground, Long Lane, Bermondsey. He
had been a widower for some years previously,
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>his wife, Eleanor, who was of Rotherhithe, having
died 13th of First Month, 1708-9, aged 65 years.</p>

<p class='c004'>However much faith may vary and forms of
belief change, men will always respect those who
listen to the voice of conscience, and obey that
inward monitor when its behests bring scorn and
persecution. The Quakers had the true martyr-spirit,
and would not abate a single iota of their
testimony either for the fear or the favour of man.
In Lurting’s narrative we see the plain, straightforward
character of the man. There is no
evidence of self-consciousness to mar the picturesque
force of the essentially heroic quality of
his deeds. Liverpool can boast of some great
names, but let her cherish the name of her
Quaker hero, “the Fighting Sailor turned
peaceable Christian.”</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Kufic Coins found in Lancashire.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>In the great find of coins at Cuerdale in
North Lancashire, besides a single Byzantine
piece there were several Kufic coins, along with
some of North Italy, about a thousand French
and two thousand eight hundred Anglo-Saxon
pieces. In these coins, and in those found over the
whole of Northumbria are to be seen the evidences
of the active commercial intercourse that even in
the pre-historic ages prevailed between the Eastern
world and the people of the North of Europe, and
especially those dwelling on the shores of the
Baltic. This has been abundantly proved by the
numerous archæological discoveries made from
time to time.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Whilst Scandinavia was still in the Stone and
Bronze stages of the development of civilisation,
merchants came to the Baltic for furs, tin, and the
yellow amber so highly prized as an ornament by
the oriental women. Indeed Oppert has shown
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>that ten centuries before the Christian era the
Assyrians had at least indirect communication
with the Baltic shores, the only locality known to
the ancient world where the yellow amber could
be procured. The references to amber in
Homer and Hesiod have not passed without
dispute, but the discoveries of Greek coins in
various parts leave little or no doubt as to the
existence of commercial routes, which went from
the Black Sea, by the Dnieper, the Bug and the
Dniester, to gain the basin of the Niemen and of
the Vistula, and thence spread to the Baltic. The
amber commerce in the hands of the Milesians and
the Greeks found various routes. The Roman
women were as passionately partial to amber
ornaments as their sisters of the East, and there
is sufficient testimony as to the commercial
intercourse of Rome with the barbarians of the
North.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Arabs, although in the Middle Ages they
had the monopoly of the trade, were not its
originators, but merely continued an intercourse
that had existed from remote antiquity. The
mediæval geographers had very little precise
knowledge; but in the Mappa Mundi of the tenth
century, in the British Museum, the parts
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>of northern Europe indicated with the fewest
misconceptions are the countries of the amber
trade. The rapid conquest of western Asia
by the Arabs was followed by those internal
dissensions which led to the formation of independent
kingdoms. The Samanides, who reigned
in Persia and dominated the shores of the Caspian
Sea, were the principal cultivators of the North
trade. The Arabs, if they had little taste for
maritime commerce, were admirably adapted to
be the leaders of great caravans, by which the
riches of the East were spread into far lands.
From Egypt they went across the Sahara to
Nigritia, from whence they brought gold, ivory,
and slaves. Passing through Persia and Cashmere
they worked in the direction of India.
Crossing the immense steppes of Tartary, they
entered China by the province of Shen-si. Their
caravans to Europe passed by Armenia on the
south, and by Bokhara and Khorassan on the east.
There were great fairs at Samarcand, Teheran,
Bagdad, and other places. The merchants
directed their course to the Caspian, and halted at
Derbend before ascending the Volga. The
itinerary of these pilgrims of commerce can be
reconstructed from the Kufic coins and accompanying
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>ornaments that have been found at
Kazan, Perm, Tula, Moscow, Smolensk, Novgorod,
St. Petersburg, and other localities. The
finds of Arabic moneys in the Russian Empire
have occurred almost exclusively in the country
watered by the Volga, which was the line of
communication for the Arabs with the Slavs and
Scandinavians of the Middle Ages. The shores
of Germany, Lithuania, and Sweden were visited.
The most northerly discoveries of Kufic coins
have been by the river Angermann, which empties
itself in the Gulf of Bothnia. The islands of
Gothland, Oland, and Bornholm appear to have
been the centre of this commercial activity.
Lithuania, Denmark, and Poland, especially the
latter, have also yielded to the antiquarian
investigator many evidences of intercourse with
the Arabs. On the coasts of Pomerania and
along the course of the Oder Kufic coins have
been found, the southern limit being apparently
in Silesia.</p>

<p class='c004'>Worsaae in speaking of some silver ornaments
with a triangular pattern of three or four points,
also found at Cuerdale, says “that the discovery
of so many coins of this class in Russia, from the
Caspian and the Black Sea up to the shores of
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>the Baltic, sufficiently proves that from the eighth
until the eleventh century there existed a very
lively intercourse by trade between the East and
the northern parts of Europe.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>The Vikings, who are usually regarded as
simply pirates, had their share in this commerce.
From the East came rich fabrics, ornaments and
vases, and their bearers carried back in return
ermines, furs, slaves, and, above all, amber, which
whilst valued as an ornament was also credited
with wonderful powers of preserving the health of
the wearer. This commerce did not have so
much social or political result as might have been
expected from four centuries of activity. The
grave events alike in Asia and Europe which
followed the fall of the Samanides interrupted its
peaceful course, and before it could fall again into
the old tracks there came the tempestuous
interlude of the first Crusade.</p>

<p class='c004'>From this it will be seen that the occurrence of
Kufic coins in the north of England is one of the
evidences of the activity of the Danes, and of
their commercial intercourse with the nations of
the East.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Newspapers in 1738-39.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>It may not be uninteresting to describe some
of the oldest surviving fragments of Lancashire
newspapers which were formerly in the
collection of Sir Thomas Baker, and are now, with
many others, in the Manchester Free Library.
After a fragment of one leaf we have “<cite>The
Lancashire Journal</cite>: with the history of the
Holy Bible.” Monday, October 16th, 1738.
Num. xvi. The printer and publishers are thus
set forth:—“Manchester: printed and sold by
John Berry at the Dial near the Cross, and Sold

Mr. Sears at the White-Lyon in Liverpool,

in Wakefield; at which places also are
taken in all sorts of advertisements to be inserted
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>in this Paper at Two Shillings and Sixpence
Each.” There is, after the fashion of the time,
very little local news, the object of these early
journals being to tell the people what was going
on at a distance. We hear (October 16th) of
the offence given by the “French strollers” in
attempting to perform a play in their own language
at the Haymarket. The “patriots” were so riotous
in their resentment that “the encouragers of these
French Vagabonds, durst not in any Coffee-House
or Place where the most Polite resort, either
Publickly avow their Sentiments, or declare their
Resentment.” From Bristol there is news of
rioting by the colliers of Kingswood, as a practical
objection to a reduction of wages, from sixteen to
twelve pence per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next relic is <cite>The Lancashire Journal</cite>,
published by John Berry, at the Dial, in Manchester,
Monday, July 30th, 1739. No. 57. The
first or leading article sets forth the intention of
the managers to “introduce” the journals “with
a short Essay, Letter, or Discourse, on some
useful Subject, Art or Science,” if they can do it
without leaving out any “material Paragraph of
News.” After a column of foreign affairs, we
have an account from “Exon” of one William
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>Wood, who was in the County Ward for £700 at
the suit of the King. After having made his
chamber-mates drunk, he fastened a rope to the
window, lowered himself down near thirty feet, and
then by the aid of a scaling-ladder got into a field
and so away. “Last Wednesday a Gentlewoman,
aged 87, who lives in Mount Street, Grosvenor
Square, was married at St. George’s Chapel, near
Hyde Park Corner, to a young Gentleman of 23.
The Bride was with difficulty led into the Chapel,
and was so much fatigued with standing till the
ceremony was over, that the Minute they were
out of the Chapel they were obliged to go into a
Tavern to get something to revive her exhausted
spirits.” Then we learn that at the Old Bailey
twenty-seven prisoners were tried, of whom two
were sentenced to be hanged, and thirteen to be
transported, whilst twelve were acquitted. Some
more paragraphs of the same nature show how
ineffectual were the sanguinary laws which condemned
men to death for slight offences. In one
of these figures “Francis Trumbles the Quaker,
who was to be hung for robbing Mr. Brow on the
highway.” “Last week died in Water Lane, Fleet
Street, one Anne Deacon, an elderly woman, who
used to ask Alms at Church Doors and elsewhere,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>in whose rooms after her death were found 100
guineas, £35 in silver, and a bond of £150 on a
considerable tradesman.” There is a good deal
more of foreign news, and the number terminates
with <em>two</em> advertisements, one only being local,
which offers an apothecary’s shop, near the
Exchange, “to be Sold or Lett. * * Enquire, for
further particulars of Mrs. Margaret Dickenson,
at the Turk’s Head, in Manchester.” No. 61,
August 27th, 1739, opens with a dissertation on the
figure of the earth, followed by an account of one of
the Dublin Incorporated Society’s English Protestant
Working Schools, then some foreign news, of
which our forefathers would appear to have been
very fond. This number is almost entirely filled
with paragraphs relating to our differences with
Spain, diplomatic and martial. We have also news
of the siege of Belgrade, and “that the Grand Vizer
has ordered a vast quantity of scaling-ladders to be
made, which looks as if he intended to take
Belgrade by storm.” From Cork we have the
news that Matthew Buckinger died there August
24th. Buckinger was born without hands or feet,
and his performances in penmanship were
certainly wonderful under the circumstances.
“The King has ordered the two Hazard tables
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>at Kensington to be suppressed.” Two advertisements
conclude this number—one of a
horse stolen or strayed from Cross Hall Park,
near Ormskirk; the other of Miller’s “Gardeners’
Dictionary” and Chambers’s “Cyclopædia,” books
on sale by Mr. Newton and Mr. Hodges,
booksellers in Manchester. The journal ends,
“Manchester: Printed by John Berry, at the
Dial, near the Cross, and sold by Mr. Nichison,

<p class='c004'>Sir Thomas Baker was also the possessor of
three numbers of another early Manchester paper.
Whitworth’s “<cite>Manchester Magazine</cite>, with the
History of the Holy Bible.” Tuesday, January
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>16th, 1738-9. No. 107 is a small, dingy folio
of four pages. Its opening paragraphs are
devoted to Muley Abdalah, who, in his abdicating
the throne of Morocco, expressed “a
great regret that he had cut off but 2,000 heads
at most.” We have then a dreadful thunderstorm
at Bristol, and a quantity of Court and personal
gossip. From “Hawick, in Northumberland,
December 14th. This day, died here (aged 105),
Mr. William Baxter. He taught school in his
youth, afterwards followed malting very closely
for above sixty years, and though he lived very
freely all that while he was never known to have
any disorder but one only, occasioned by a over-discharge
of bad liquor, which was carried off
by a vomit.” The old gentleman was hearty to
the last, and knocked under to “a common fever,
which as an Argument of his great vigour
terminated in a Phrenzy, and in a week’s
Time despatch’d him.” We hear of a wolf
breaking loose, which was kept by a gentleman
who lives near the vineyard in St. James’s Park,
and of the mischief it wrought upon—two milk
pails; of an attempted escape from Newgate;
and of sundry highway robberies. We have

<p class='c004'>Next we have a letter relating a sharp trick of
some American-Spaniards, followed by the sage
reflection that “its greatly to be lamented that

very unreasonable, because the publick reaps the

<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>of a sale by auction at the Angel, at
Manchester. From No. 111, February 13th,
1738-9, excluding most of the foreign news,
we glean the following items:—“London,
February 6th.—Last week two persons were
sent to prison by the Bench of Justices
at Hick’s Hall for endeavouring to seduce
some manufacturers in the glass trade, in order to
send them to Holland, where a glass house is
lately set up, and who very much underwork us

is to be hoped that the Parliament will take these
affairs into consideration.—Yesterday morning a

him into a ditch, after which they made off.—Last

of talk about the convention with Spain, which
need not be repeated. These citations may
suffice. They are fair samples of what may be
found in the local newspapers of the first half
of the eighteenth century. The early Lancashire
journalist was a man of many parts. Thus the
<cite>Lancashire Journal</cite>, in December, 1740, is said
to be “printed by John Berry, Watchmaker and

<p class='c004'>We cannot estimate the feelings of our great-grandfathers

  <h2 class='c000'>A Lancashire Naturalist: Thomas Garnett.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_6 c003'>A memorial volume of the late Mr.
Thomas Garnett, of Low Moor, Clitheroe,
was printed for private circulation, and some
notice of it will be of interest to many outside the
narrow circle for whom it was originally prepared.
Mr. Thomas Garnett was one of three brothers.
Mr. Richard Garnett distinguished himself as a
philologist, and became an assistant-keeper in the
British Museum; Mr. Jeremiah Garnett was for
many years the editor of the <cite>Manchester
Guardian</cite>, and Mr. Thomas Garnett settled at
Clitheroe, where he passed an active life as a
manufacturer, but instead of allowing business to
absorb all his attention, he found pleasant and
healthful recreation in agricultural and scientific
observation. The results are now gathered in
this volume—“Essays in Natural History and
Agriculture, by the late Thomas Garnett, of Low
Moor, Clitheroe. London: printed at the
Chiswick Press, 1883.” Only 250 copies were
printed. The editing has been the work of the
author’s nephew, that accomplished scholar and
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>friend of all students, Dr. Richard Garnett, of the
British Museum. The first paper contains a
number of facts and observations relating to the
salmon, chiefly based on Mr. Garnett’s experience
in Lancashire. Written as long ago as 1834, it
contains a plea in favour of a wise and not
vexatious measure for the protection of the
salmon fisheries. He believed that the salmon
enters and ascends rivers for other purposes than
propagation. In support of this view he cites
what in Lancashire is called “streaming.” Thus
in winter the fish not engaged in spawning, trout,
grayling, chub, dace, etc., leave the streams and
go into deep water. Another reason is their
impatience of heat, which leads the grayling, if
the weather is unusually hot at the end of May or
beginning of June, to ascend the mill-streams in
the Wharfe, by hundreds, and to go up the mill-races
as far as they can get. The “salmon” par
he holds to be neither a hybrid, nor a distinct
species, but a state of the common salmon. In
1851 he wrote some papers describing his own
experiments in the artificial breeding of salmon.
His interest in the fish is shown by the following
quotation:—“I have had fish sent from two
different gentlemen living on the banks of the
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>reservoirs belonging to the Liverpool Waterworks:
these were beautiful fish, three in number,
more like the sea trout than the salmon, and the
largest of them weighing two pounds. I had put
them into the brooks running into the reservoirs
three years before. I also learn that a beautiful
specimen of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ombre chevalier</span></i> (French char)
was taken out of Rivington reservoir. About a
thousand had been put in by me two years
before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It should be mentioned that Mr. Garnett’s
experiments on the artificial impregnation of fish
ova were made without any knowledge of previous
attempts of the same kind. In answer to a
suggestion made by Mr. Garnett, the late Sir G.
C. Lewis observed:—“You might as well propose
to shoot partridges only three days a week as to
restrict the netting of salmon to only three days.”
In 1859, Mr. Garnett wrote some papers on the
possibility of introducing salmon into Australia,
and addressed a communication to the authorities
of Tasmania and New Zealand on the subject.
He had some doubts as to success, but thought
that the experiment should be made, and that
New Zealand was the likeliest place for the
experiment. In 1843, 1844, 1845, and 1848, he
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>made experiments in the cultivation of wheat on
the same land in successive years, and the results
were communicated to the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>.
He also advocated the growing of a short-strawed
wheat as peculiarly suitable to the conditions of
farming in Lancashire and Yorkshire. The
gravelling of his clay soils elicited some amusing
comments from his neighbours, one of whom
remarked that he had seen land tilled (manured)
in various ways, but had never before seen a field
tilled with cobble-stones! The cultivation of
cotton in India and in Peru was another project
in which he took a warm interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Garnett was a keen observer of natural
history. Some excellent authorities had asserted
that the common wren never lined its nest with
feathers, but he showed conclusively that this was
a mistake. The nest in which eggs are laid is
profusely lined with feathers, but during the
period of incubation the male frequently constructs
several nests in the vicinity of the first,
none of which are lined. The existence of these
“cock-nests,” as they are called by schoolboys,
was doubted, but Mr. Garnett fully made out his
case. The grey wagtail (<i>Motacilla sulphurea</i>)
sometimes looks at its own image in a window,
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>and attacks it with great vivacity. A superstitious
neighbour was alarmed by this conduct in
a “barley-bird” (<i>Motacilla flava</i>), and thought it
a portent of evil. Her alarm was cured by the
young naturalist, who secured the bird of evil
omen. Having caught a colony of the long-tailed
titmouse, Mr. Garnett and his brother attempted
to rear the half-fledged young ones, but of the six
old birds, five died in confinement. The survivor
was allowed to escape in the hope that it would
come back to rear the young ones. This it did,
and by the most unwearied exertions supplied the
whole brood, sometimes feeding them ten times
in a minute. Mr. Garnett took some pains to
establish the identity of the green with the wood-sandpiper.
The courage of the stoat, and the
pertinacious manner in which the marsh-titmouse
for a time resisted attempts to drive her from her
nest, are amongst his curious observations. The
creeper, he noticed, associated with the titmouse
in winter. The language of birds has not yet
been mastered, either by philologists or ornithologists,
but it appears that the alarm note of one
is readily understood by those of other species.
Mr. Garnett desired to make some young throstles
leave a nest which was in danger of visitation
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>from mischievous lads. He took one from the
nest and made it cry out. Its brethren quickly
disappeared, the old bird set up a shriek of alarm,
and blackbird, chaffinch, robin, oxeye, blue titmouse,
wren, and marsh-titmouse, and even the
golden-crested wren, which usually appears to
care for nothing; in fact all the birds in the wood,
except the creeper, came to see what was the
matter. Mr. Garnett did not share the prejudice
felt by some farmers against the rook, which he
held to be serviceable to man. He reckoned that
one rookery in Wharfedale destroyed 209 tons of
worms, insects and their larvæ. The rook also,
he notes, relieves the farmers from the apprehension
caused by a flight of locusts in Craven.
Contrary to Waterton’s opinion, Mr. Garnett
describes the process by which birds dress their
feathers with oil from a gland. The sedge-warbler
owes its local name of “mocking-bird”
to its imitative powers in copying the notes
of the swallow, the martin, the house-sparrow,
spring-wagtail, whinchat, starling, chaffinch,
white-throat, greenfinch, little redpole, whin-linnet,
and other birds. Of the water-ouzel
he says:—“A pair had built for forty years,
according to tradition, in a wheel-race near to
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>where I was born, and had never been molested
by anybody, until a gentleman in the neighbourhood,
who was a great ornithologist, employed his
gamekeeper to shoot this pair. I think the
natives of Calcutta were not more indignant when
an unlucky Englishman got one of their sacred
bulls into his compound, and baited him, than was
our little community at what we considered so
great an outrage. The gamekeeper narrowly
escaped being stoned by myself and some more
lads, any one of whom would have shot fifty
blackbirds or fieldfares without any misgiving.”
Mr. Garnett once shot what he afterwards
believed to have been a Sabine’s snipe.</p>

<p class='c004'>His interest in the river was not confined to
the salmon, and he made some interesting observations
on the propagation of lampreys, the
spawning of minnows, and the breeding of eels.
A short note on the last-named topic, by Mr.
Jeremiah Garnett, is also printed. On the formation
of ice at the bottom of rivers, there are two
papers, one by Mr. Thomas Garnett, and the
other by his brother, the Rev. Richard Garnett.
A shower of gossamer, the thread produced by
the aëronautic spider, is recorded as seen on the
hills near Blackburn. One of Mr. Garnett’s
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span><a id='friend' name='friend'></a>friends was the unfortunate Mr. Joseph Ritchie,
of Otley, who accompanied Captain Lyon’s expedition
to Fezzan, and died there in 1819. To
this there is an allusion in the following passage:—“In
conclusion, allow me to say that the leisure
hours which a somewhat busy life has enabled me
to spend in these pursuits, have been some of the
happiest of my existence, and have awakened and
cherished such an admiration of nature, and such
a love of the country and its scenes, as I think
can never be appreciated by the inhabitants of
large towns, and which I cannot describe so well
as in the words of one of my friends, in a beautiful
apostrophe to England, when leaving it, never to
return:—</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>The Traffords of Trafford.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>The Trafford tradition is that the family
were settled at Trafford as early as the reign
of Canute. Radulphus, or Randolph, who is said
to have died in the reign of Edward the Confessor,
appears in the pedigree as the father of Radulphus,
who “received the King’s protection from Sir
Hamo de Massey, about the year 1080.” From
the daughter of Hamo, Richard de Trafford had
that entire lordship. To this early and obscure
portion of the annals we must refer the tradition
of the Trafford Crest, of which Arthur Agarde
writes thus in 1600:—“The auncyentteste I know
or have read is, that of the Trafords or Traford
in Lancashire, whose arms [crest] are a labouring
man, with a flayle in his hand threshinge, and this
written motto, ‘Now thus,’ which they say came
by this occasion: That he and other gentlemen
opposing themselves against some Normans who
came to invade them, this Traford did them much
hurte, and kept the passages against them. But
that at length the Normans having passed the
ryver came sodenlye upon him, and then, he
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>disguising himself, went into his barne, and was
threshing when they entered, yet beinge knowen
by some of them and demanded why he so abased
himself, answered, ‘Now thus.’” At the fancy
dress ball in connection with the Preston Guild of
1823 “Mr. Trafford was remarkably dressed in his
own crest: a Clown in parti-coloured clothes,
a flail in his hand and a motto, ‘Now thus.’” A
similar crest was borne by the Asshetons and the
Pilkingtons. The legend was told of a Pilkington
to Fuller, who has given it a place in his
“Worthies of England.” It is now impossible to
tell if it has any foundation at all in actual fact.
Another undated tradition is that of a “duel”
between John of Trafford and Gilbert of Ashton,
in which the latter was slain and buried by his
antagonist in a field called Barnfield Bank, near
Urmston Hall. Following the order of the
pedigree we have as holders of the Trafford
estates Radulphus, Radulphus, Robertus, Henricus,
Henry, Richard, of whom little or nothing is
known. They are followed by a succession of
five Henrys, of whom the two last were knights.
John, the son of the fifth, having died young, the
estates passed to the grandson of the old knight.
This sixth Henry came of age in 1336, was
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>knighted, and, dying about 1370, left seven sons,
and was succeeded by another Sir Henry, who
died about 1386. His son, the eighth Henry,
who did not attain to the knightly dignity, died
in 1396, leaving a son six years old, who died
about 1403, and was succeeded by his brother
Edmund, who was knighted by King Henry VI.
at Whitsuntide, 1426.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1422, the parish church of Manchester was
collegiated by the action of the last rector and
lord of the manor, Thomas de la Warre. The
parishioners were gathered together at the sound
of the bell to confirm and accept the arrangements
he had made for the better service of the church.
After Sir John le Byron and Sir John de Radcliffe,
the first gentleman named is Edmund Trafford.
Then follow representatives of the families of
Booth, Longford, Holland, Strangeways, Hyde,
Barlow, Hopwood, and others. Sir Edmund
Trafford married Alice, the daughter of Sir
William Venables. This union took place in 1409,
when the bride was but eleven years of age. The
little lady was co-heiress with her sister, Douce or
Dulcia, of the lands of her brother Richard, the
last male heir, who was drowned in the Bollin at
the early age of eight, in the year 1402. She was
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>born at Worsley and baptised at Eccles Church.
One who witnessed the ceremony was David
le Seintpier, and the ceremony was impressed
upon his mind by the uncomfortable circumstance
that he was setting out on a pilgrimage to Our
Lady of Walsingham when he was thrown from
his horse and broke his leg. This form of artificial
memory, though effectual in his case, can hardly
be recommended for imitation. Sir Edmund de
Trafford was in the confidence of Henry VI.,
whose dreams of avarice he fanned by visions of
the philosopher’s stone, and of the possibility
of changing all the baser metals into gold and
silver. On the 7th of April, 1446, the King
granted a patent to this Trafford and to Sir
Thomas Ashton, setting forth that certain persons
had maligned them with the character of working
by unlawful arts, and might disturb them in their
experiments, and, therefore, the King gave them
special lease and licence to work and try their art
and science, lawfully and freely, in spite of any
statute or order to the contrary. The King, in
issuing this commission, was overriding the
provision of 5 Henry IV., c. 4. Sir Edmund
lived until 1457, and if he succeeded in finding the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum potabile</span></i>, he carried the secret with him
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>to the grave. In 1435, Elizabeth, daughter of
Sir Edmund Trafford, married Sir John Pilkington.
The deeds are still extant by which Pilkington
endowed his bride at the porch of the collegiate
church of Manchester. He entered into a bond
to pay 200 marks in silver, and also “swere upon
a boke” that he stood “sole seiset in his demene
as of fee simple or fee tail, the day of weddynge,”
of the lands of his father, including the dower
land of his mother, dame Margery.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next holder of the estate, Sir John de
Trafford, “belonged to the great Earl of Warwick,”
and with his retainers fought for the Red Rose
of Lancashire under the banner of the King-maker.
His allowance was twenty marks yearly, in addition
to the wages usual for one of his degree. For
some reason now difficult, if not impossible, to
ascertain, he resigned his estates to his son
Edmund, the offspring of a marriage with the
daughter of Sir Thomas Ashton, of Ashton-under-Lyne.
One of his sisters married Sir John
Ashton. Sir John Trafford transferred his estates
in 1484, and died in 1488. Edmund Trafford
married the young widow of John Honford, and
had the guardianship of her first husband’s only
son and heir. This was granted to him in a
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>document which is worth quoting as an example
alike of the customs and language of the time:—“Be
hit knowen to all men wher now of late the

<p class='c004'>The boy became a bold soldier, and was slain
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>at Flodden Field in 1515, and with him ended
the male line of the ancient family of Honford.
His daughter Margaret married, before she was
twelve, Sir John Stanley, the stout knight, whose
life forms a curious episode in mediæval biography.
He was the son of James Stanley, the warlike
Bishop of Ely, and Warden of Manchester, who
was blamed by Fuller for “living all the winter at
Somersham, in Huntingdonshire, with one who
was not his sister, and who wanted nothing to
make her his wife save marriage.” Young
Stanley took part in the battle of Flodden, and
is thought to have been knighted in the field.
Notwithstanding his prowess he appears to have
been “sicklied o’er with a pale cast of thought,”
his favourite mottos being those of the preacher
who declares <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vanitas vanitatum omnia vanitas</span></i>.
In 1523, he became engaged in a dispute with one
of the Leghs, of Adlington, who had married the
daughter of a reputed mistress of Cardinal Wolsey.
That haughty prelate summoned Sir John to
London, and committed him to the Fleet until he
surrendered his lease. Sir John founded a chantry
in the church of Manchester, and arranged his
estates for the benefit of his wife and child.
Then by mutual consent a divorce was pronounced
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>between him and Dame Margaret, and
he became a monk of the Order of St. Benedict
in the abbey of Westminster. His wife, when
the divorce was arranged, intended to enter a
nunnery, but anticipating the sentiment of a once
popular song, she altered her mind, and married
Sir Urian Brereton. When Stanley settled his
property he directed that his son was not to be
married until he was twenty-one, and then he was
to choose his own wife by the advice of the Abbot
of Westminster and Edmund Trafford.</p>

<p class='c004'>The guardian of the monk’s childhood carried
forward the fortunes of the Traffords, for in
1514 he was created a Knight of the Bath by
Henry VIII. His son, the second Sir Edmund,
was born in 1485, and died at the age of forty-eight,
leaving behind him five sons and five
daughters. Sir Edmund was one of the first
feoffees of the Manchester Grammar School.
When the school was built the east part of it
adjoined “a stone chymney” of George Trafford’s.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henry Trafford, the younger brother of Sir
Edmund, who died in 1537, was rector of
Wilmslow, and built the chancel and placed
stained glass in many of the windows. He was
the youngest son of the Sir Edmund Trafford
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>who died in 1514. His monument in Wilmslow
Church represents a tonsured priest in ecclesiastical
costume. The inscription, now illegible,
set forth his clerical honours as “licensed doctor
of divinity,” formerly Chancellor of York Cathedral,
and rector of Bolton Percy, Siglisthorne, and
Wilmslow. He was succeeded by Henry Ryle,
who, in 1542, resigned to make way for another
Henry Trafford, who was rector of Wilmslow for
nearly fifty years. He died in 1591. His will
contains several interesting provisions. He was
anxious to be buried in the same tomb as his
uncle and predecessor, and left 6s. 8d. to be paid
for his funeral sermon. Evidently disapproving
of sable trappings, he desired that there should be
no mourning gowns at his funeral, but that a
“worshipful dinner” should be made for the
friends that should happen to attend. His best
gown he left to the curate of Wilmslow, and the
furniture of the parsonage was to remain for the
use of whoever should be his successor.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>The third Sir Edmund, born in 1507, was
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>knighted by the Earl of Hertford, in Scotland,
in the thirty-sixth year of King Henry VIII.
He was with the King at the siege of Boulogne,
and died in 1564. He married a daughter of the
knightly house of Radcliffe. His brother Thomas
was the founder of the Traffords of Essex. Sir
Edmund, in 1542, paid tax on £80 as the value of
his Lancashire property. In Mary’s reign he was
captain of the military musters of Salford hundred,
and High Sheriff of the county. “Between 1542
and 1558,” says Mr. J. E. Bailey, “Sir Edmund
Trafford was interested in promoting, in the
church, the advancement of the following persons,
who, belonging in some cases to the families of
his tenants, were ordained at Chester upon the
knight’s title: Dns Alexander Chorlton; Dns
Alexander Hugson (or Hudson); Dns Robert
Williamson; Dns Johannes Gregorie; Dns Willm’s
Trafforde; Dns Jacobus Walker. Thomas Acson,
of the diocese of Chester, an acolyte in April,
1546, soon afterwards became sub-dean, deacon,
and presbyter on the title of Edmund Trafford,
co. Lincoln, gentleman. The Trafford family
had connections in Lincolnshire. George Trafford,
a younger son of the Sir Edmund who died
in 1514, had lands in Lincoln, but lived in the
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>neighbourhood of Manchester, and in dying left
provision for certain copes and vestments (which
had been bought by his father-in-law) ‘to be
restored again for the service of God.’” In 1564,
a curious legal document was executed between
Edmund Trafford, of Trafford, Esquire, and John
Boothe, of Barton, Esquire, by which it was
agreed that Edmund’s son (also Edmund) should
marry Marget Boothe, daughter of the said John,
and if she died before the union was completed he
was to marry Anne, and in her default any other
daughter of Boothe’s who might be her father’s
heir. If Edmund died his next remaining brother
in succession was to take his place. Moreover, if
Boothe had any male issue a similar marriage was
to be arranged with a daughter of the house of
Trafford. In point of fact the feelings and dispositions
of the young folk were not dreamed of
as being of any account, and the future of their
respective offspring, born and unborn, was dealt
with by the seniors in the most arbitrary fashion,
with the sole view of joining together the great
estates of the two families. The fourth Sir
Edmund was born in 1526, and died in 1590.
His first wife was a sister of Queen Catharine
Howard. By his second marriage, with Elizabeth,
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>the daughter of Ralph Leicester, of Toft, he had
three children. In 1586, the marriage of his
daughter was celebrated with great pomp at
Trafford, the Earl of Derby, the Bishop of
Chester, “with divers knights and esquires of
great worship,” were present, and the wedding-sermon,
which still survives, was preached by
William Massie, <span class='fss'>B.D.</span>, who dedicates it to Sir
Edmund. “I having right honourably received,”
he says, “by your good means, great courtesies,
both in the country and at my studie at Oxford.”
He was a Fellow of Brasenose College, and had
been helped in his education by Sir Edmund.
The conclusion of the dedication is worth
quoting:—“For your selfe as you have long been
a principal protection of God’s trueth and a great
countenance and credit to the preachers thereof
in those quarters, and have hunted out and unkenneled
those slie and subtil foxes the Jesuites
and seminarie Priests out of their celles and
caves to the uttermost of your power, with the
great ill will of many both open and private enimies
to the prince and the church, but your rewarde is
with the Lorde, and as you have maintained
still your house with great hospitality in no point
dimming the glory of your worthy predecessors,
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>but rather adding to it: So I pray God stil continue
your zeale, your liberality, your loyaltie and
fidelitie, to your Prince, Church, and Common
Wealth, that here you may live long with encrease
of worship and after the race of your life wel runne
here you maie be partaker of those unspeakable
ioies in the kingdome of Heaven which be prepared
for all the elect children of God, unto whose
blessed protection I recommend you and al yours.
Amen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was, like his father, a staunch Protestant, and
is credited with special activity against the partisans
of the old faith. Lancashire was regarded
as a hot-bed of Popery, and Manchester was
thought a convenient place “wherein to confine
and imprison such Papists as they thought meet,
and to train up their children in the Protestant
religion.” Chaderton, Bishop of Chester, was a
resident in the town, and some of the children of
the Roman Catholic gentry were committed to
his charge. In 1580, Trafford wrote to the Earl
of Leicester complaining that the state of Lancashire
was lamentable to behold, for mass was
said in several places, and if harsh measures were
not used “our country is utterly overthrown. I
know no lenity will do any good by experience.”
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>Towards the close of 1582, Sir Edmund apprehended
a priest named John Baxter, who, “for
the more ease of Sir Edmund Trafford,” was
committed to the common gaol until the next
assizes. The zealous priest-hunters were “righte
hartelie” thanked by the Privy Council for their
activity. The persecuting spirit was exhibited in
1583, when, at the quarter sessions held in Manchester,
two priests, Williamson and Hatton, who
had been arrested by Sir Edmund, and James
Bell, a priest, who had been apprehended by the
Earl of Derby, were indicted for high treason for
“extolling the Pope’s authority, &amp;c.” Bell and a
recusant, named Finch, were condemned to death,
and executed at Lancaster. Their heads were
placed on the steeple of the Manchester Parish
Church. At the same sessions, Sir John Southworth
and seven other gentlemen were fined for
recusancy, each having to pay £240. The same
fine was imposed upon a number of priests and
“common persons.” Of four women it is remarked
that, “although they be very obstinate, and have
done great harm, yet being indicted it was not
thought good to arraign them.” The next year,
1584, we find Trafford, at the instigation of Bishop
Chaderton, making a descent upon Blainscough,
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>but finding that Mr. Worthington had fled, they
proceeded to Rossall to the house inhabited by
the widow of Gabriel, the brother of Cardinal
Allen. That lady having received a friendly hint
had fled, but the High Sheriff found £500, which
was secured on the plea that it was intended for
the use of the Cardinal. Her three daughters, of
whom the eldest was but sixteen, hearing that it
was intended to convey them to prison, made
their escape at midnight, and luckily finding a
boat ready, crossed the Wyre and found refuge
with friends. Ultimately, and after many hardships,
they escaped to Rome, where they
lived upon the bounty of Cardinal Allen. The
Rev. James Gosnell, writing from Bolton about
1584, says:—“Here are great store of Jesuits,
Seminaries, Masses and plenty of whoredom.
The first sort our sheriff (Edmund Trafford, Esq.)
courseth pretty well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>From Warden Herle the Traffords received,
about 1574, some ambiguous leases of the tithes
of Stretford, Trafford, and half of Chorlton, which
were ultimately decided to mean possession for
ninety-nine years after twenty-one years. This
transaction is probably the origin of the right of
the family to nominate one churchwarden and two
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>sidesmen, and to appoint the parish clerk of Manchester.
When Peploe was warden these leases
were the occasion of much trouble, and it was with
great difficulty that the Fellows obtained their
surrender. The fifth Sir Edmund was thrice
High Sheriff of Lancashire. In 1603, when
James made his progress into England, he was
received at York with great pomp and state by
the Lord Mayor and burgesses. A seminary
priest was sent to prison for presenting a petition,
and a number of gentlemen were “graced with
the honour of knighthood.” Amongst these was
Edmund Trafford, who, like his father, was a
hater of Roman Catholics, and employed a spy
named Christopher Bayley to ferret them out.
Sir Edmund died in 1620. His first wife was a
Booth, of Barton. In a second marriage he
espoused Lady Mildred Cecil, the second daughter
of the Earl of Exeter. A daughter received the
name of Cecilia, and a son the name of Cecil, in
honour of the mother’s family. In 1584, there was
a levy of 200 men for the service of the Queen in
her Irish wars, and that the Lancashire lads might
not be committed to strange captains who “for
the most part” had not used their soldiers “with
the love and care that appertained,” one of their
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>own shire, Edmund Trafford, eldest son of Sir
Edmund Trafford, Knight, was appointed their
commander. Two years later an entry in the
Court Leet book shows that the town paid £16
to Mr. Trafford and Mr. Edmund Assheton for
the “makeing of soldiers into Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Cecil Trafford, who was born in 1599, and
knighted by King James at Houghton Tower in
1617, succeeded his father in 1620. Leonard
Smethley writes from Manchester, 10th May,
1620, that Sir Edmund Trafford was buried on
the 8th at Manchester Church by torchlight,
and had a funeral sermon by candle-light, leaving
a will so ambiguous that the heir who should
inherit could not be known. Sir Urian Legh, of
Adlington, and Sir Peter Legh, of Lyme, were
expected to meet for the ordering and establishing
of quietness amongst the four brethren.
Smethley, with a keen eye to business, wanted
to secure Sir Edmund’s “hearse-cloth” as a
perquisite of the College of Arms, whose minion
he was. From the Reformation the Traffords
had been staunch Protestants, and Sir Edmund
in particular was a vigorous hunter of recusants.
In his earlier years Sir Cecil was thought to be
tainted with Puritanism, and in an excess of
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>religious ardour engaged in an attempt to bring
back a convert, Mr. Francis Downes, who had
gone over to Rome. This entry into the thorny
fields of controversy had an unexpected result.
Sir Cecil found himself converted by the very
arguments he had sought out only to confute.
Sir Cecil married a daughter of Sir Humphrey
Davenport, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer,
and his daughter Penelope, named after her
mother, became the wife of John Downes, of
Wardley, the brother and heir of the man whose
reclamation the Knight of Trafford had attempted
with so curious a result. His grandson,
Roger Downes, was the young rake whose
tragic fate has given rise to the story of the
“skullhouse.” The death of the Rector of
Ashton-on-Mersey, who was drowned on Good
Friday, in 1632, “being, as it is feared, somewhat
overcharged with drink,” the suicide of
the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge on Easter
Day, and the controversy between two Fellows
of the College as to the nature of sin, seemed
to new converts like Trafford and Downes
“signal evidences of God’s anger and wrath,
and presages of the ruin of the reformed religion.”
It has, however, been claimed that the re-conversion
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>of the Traffords, the Downes, and the
Sherburnes was the work of Richard Hudleston,
a Lancashire Benedictine monk, who prosecuted
the dangerous mission of keeping alive Roman
Catholicism in England, and died in 1655, at the
age of seventy-five. In 1580, there was <a id='at' name='at'></a>at
Trafford a priest of this English mission, but
no particulars respecting him are known. In
religion a Roman Catholic, in politics a Royalist,
Sir Cecil played a busy part in the troublous
period of the Civil War. Ship-money, perhaps
the most momentous impost in its results ever
levied, was the subject of a letter from Sir
Cecil to Humphrey Chetham, then High Sheriff
of Lancashire, which for its quaint formalism
may be worth quoting:—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mr. Sheriffe,—I hope you will excuse mee for my late
sending you venison, for in truth I was ashamed my
keeper cold doe noe better, though he had Mr. Fox to
help him. I have in recompense of your patience sent
you a quarter of a hinde, &amp; if you need more venison I
pray lett me knowe and you shall have assoone as it will
be kild. I have perused our directions from his Maty and
the Llds for the levying of men &amp; money within this
County &amp; compared it with Cheshire, &amp; find that some
time Cheshire hath byn equall to us, sometyme deeper
charged, &amp; sometymes this County hath borne 3 parts and
Cheshire 2. Yet I clerely hold equallity is the best rate
betweene the Countys, though Cheshire be lesse yet it is
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>generally better land, and not soe much mosses and
barren ground in it. Mr. Adam Smiths is now with me
and acquainted mee with your desire, which I will as
willingly perform as you desire, if God make me able; for
I have byn a little troubled with rewme in my head this
two dayes, though I am better to-day; I have looked for
the Coppy of the letter from the Llds of the Councell for
providing a Shipp in this County, but yet I cannot find it;
but I find this proclamation for the discharge of it, and by
my remembrance in writing on the back of the proclamation
you may see the charge of money demanded by the
Kinge and Llds because the shipp could not possibly be
provided in time. I shall further acquaint you with my
booke of Lieutenancy wherein are those few notes of
remembrance. I desire to know your tyme of going, and
I will prepare myself for you accordingly, and thus with
my harty commendations to you I rest</p>

<p class='c015'>Trafford the third of January, 1634.</p>

<p class='c015'>To the right worll. my very good freind Humfrey
Chetam, esq.</p>

<p class='c015'>High Sheriffe of the County of Lancaster at his House
at Clayton these present.”</p>

<p class='c004'>These worthy gentlemen discuss the matter of
Ship Money with an exclusive eye to its purely
business aspect, and seem quite unconscious of
the momentous issues beneath these details, and
yet the freedom of England was involved in the
settlement. Sir Cecil writes from Trafford,
16th February, 1638, to William ffarington that
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“wee” have enrolled all the able men between
sixteen and sixty, “a great number,” out of
which levy may be made for the King. On
the 11th of March he writes again that he has
been to the houses of various gentlemen as
requested, to see who would help with arms
or money for the Kings cause, and that “few
denyed.” In 1639, Sir Cecil, in conjunction
with other Loyalists, “suspecting that sundry
in the towne did favour the Scots, did charge
the towne of Manchester with more arms than
ever before in the memory of man it had been
charged with, which war being composed they
had their arms in their own possession.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1642, Sir William Gerard, Sir Cecil Trafford,
and other recusants represented to the King that
they were disarmed, and asked for his Majesty’s
protection, and that their arms might be “re-delivered
in this time of actual war.” Charles
immediately issued a commission to the Lancashire
recusants “commanding them to provide with all
possible speed sufficient arms for the defence of
his Majesty’s person or them against all force
raised by any colour of any order or ordinance
whatsoever without his Majesty’s consent.” This
was answered by the Parliament sending down
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>Sir John Seaton, and by the issue of orders for
“putting down associations of Papists in Lancashire,
Cheshire, and the five northern counties.”
In December, 1642, Sir Cecil was imprisoned as a
recusant by the Parliamentarians, probably in the
same prison to which his relative had consigned
so many for recusancy. The death of Sir Cecil’s
two eldest-born sons caused the estates to pass to
the third, who received the name of Humphrey
from his grandfather Davenport. Another brother
was John Trafford, of Croston. The eldest of
Humphrey’s sons died unmarried at Angiers;
the second, Humphrey, was married at Manchester
in 1701 to a daughter of Sir Ralph
Assheton, but the numerous offspring of this
union left no children. In 1670, Henry Newcome’s
heart was sorely troubled about the fate of his
son Daniel, who was on a voyage to Jamaica.
News came that the ships, with their two guardian
men-of-war, had, after a two days’ fight, been
captured by the Turks. The first imperfect
rumour reached him on Saturday, and it was not
until the succeeding Thursday that, when visiting
Dunham he saw the story told more plainly. He
enters it thus in his diary:—“That seven Turkish
men-of-war set upon them two ships and other
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>merchant ships near the Cape de Gat, and that the
captains were slain, but they fought it out two
days, and the Turks were glad to desist from their
engagement. This satisfied me that there might
be no captivity in the case; but then I knew not
but that my child might be killed in the fight;
and so it rested with me till Saturday. Then
going to Trafford, I discoursed of that part of the
news, and Mr. Trafford showed me that Cape de
Gat was in the midst of the Mediterranean, and
150 miles within the Straits; by which it was
apparent that the Amity bound for Tangier was
gone off before.” Dan was not carried into
Turkish captivity, but returned to Manchester,
and his father was mortified at not being able to
obtain employment for him with “Mr. Trafford.”
It is to be remarked that at this date Sir Cecil
was still living. He was buried 29th November,
1672.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next squire of Trafford also bore the name
of Humphrey. He married a daughter of Sir
Oswald Mosley, but the union was childless.
In the very curious “Characteristic Strictures,”
written by the Rev. Thomas Seddon, and consisting
of remarks on an imaginary exhibition of
portraits of Lancashire and Cheshire notabilities,
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>we have the following picture of him as “the good
Samaritan”: “That universal benevolence is an
enemy to restraint, and that character is not the
effect of an illiberal spirit, is here most laudably
expressed. The pure motives of compassion
cannot be restrained by religious tenets; the
manner in which these sentiments actuate the
Samaritan to relieve his fellow-creature in distress,
is most beautifully sublime, and every after-stroke
gives lustre to the whole. The formality of the
habit is the only fault in this performance, as it is
better calculated for a recluse than a travelling
character.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By a will dated June 5th, 1779, the estates
were devised by Humphrey to his collateral
cousin, John Trafford, of Croston, who settled at
the ancient home of his race, and obtained an act
of Parliament in 1793 giving him power to let
lands on building leases, and to lease the waste
moss lands in the parishes of Manchester and
Eccles for ninety-nine years. Mr. Thomas Joseph
Trafford, who in 1815 succeeded to the estate,
was the fifth son, and was born at Croston in
1778. His marriage, in 1803, with the daughter
of Mr. Francis Colman, of Hellersdown, Devonshire,
resulted in a family of fourteen children.
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>He was a county magnate of high consideration,
served as High Sheriff in 1834, and was in 1841
created a baronet and received the royal authority
to revert to an old method of spelling the family
name. Sir Thomas Joseph de Trafford died in
1852, and was succeeded by Sir Humphrey, who
was born in 1808, and in 1855 married the Lady
Mary Annette Talbot, the eldest sister of the
17th Earl of Shrewsbury. The numerous issue
of this union are the bearers of a name that
has endured for so many centuries that some
of the families entered in the peerages look
but like parvenus beside it. He was succeeded
by his son, Sir Humphrey, who in consequence
of the contiguity of the Manchester Ship Canal,
found it desirable to leave the old home of the
family.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>The possessions of the family in Lancashire were
thus set forth in the return of landowners in 1873,
which is generally credited with under rather than
over-estimating the value of the estates of the
larger landowners:—</p>

<p class='c004'>The family of Trafford in bygone centuries did
good service in the public work of the nation, and
if for some generations it sought obscurity, the
motive was honourable and the blame for it rested
upon those laws, alike mistaken and mischievous,
which made creeds the test of citizenship. The
most impressive fact about the ancient race of the
Traffords of Trafford is their permanence. It is
a thoroughly English attribute, and nowhere will
it attract more respect than in that place which
successive generations of the Traffords have seen
developing from the Saxon village to the busy,
bustling, modern city of Manchester. The
Traffords survive and flourish, but they are
Traffords of Trafford no more.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>A Manchester Will of the Fifteenth Century.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>The will of George Manchester, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1483,
was presented to the Peel Park Museum,
Salford, by the late Mr. Stephen Heelis. It has
several points of interest. The date is given in a
peculiar form: “the first year of the reign of
King Richard the Third after the Conquest,
when he raised his realm against the Duke of
Buckingham.” The Manchester localities mentioned
are the Irk Bridge, the Furthys (? the
Fords), the Pavey, the Spring Bank, the Butts,
the Tenter Bank, Drynghouses, Bradforth, and
Mylnegate. The family names of Fornesse,
Strangeways, Blakeley also occur. Dialectally
noticeable are the words brege (bridge), garthyn
(garden), longs (belongs), whether (whichever),
wedit (wedded), spendit (spent). The spelling of
the word lawful seems to point to the former use
of a guttural sound now fallen into disuse. The
peculiar employment of the word livelihood is also
noteworthy. The perusal of this interesting
document seems to show that in the past the
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>dialect of Lancashire approximated more closely
than at present to the Northumbrian group. The
will reads as follows:—“Be it knawen to all men
&amp; in especiall to all myn neghburs <i>th</i>at I George

<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>mared hym self.” The anxiety to keep his
belongings within the enclosure of the family name
was greater than his dislike of a bar sinister.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Lancashire and Cheshire wills published by
the Chetham Society show that the illegitimate
children were often provided for along with those
born in wedlock, and in several cases bore the
surname of their father. There are several entries
relating to the Mancestres in the manorial rent
roll of 1473, which has been translated and printed
by Mr. Harland in his “Mamcestre.” Ellen
Mancestre appears as the tenant of two burgages,
late Katherine Johnson’s, for each of which she
paid 12d. George Mancestre held a messuage in
“Le Foris” at a rent of 3s. Mr. Harland
conjectures this to be the clerkly rendering of
“the Market or the Courts.” He was also
concerned in a field near the “Galoz,” and paid
6d. as tenant of an <i>ostrina</i>, concerning which Mr.
Harland observes:—“The word we have rendered
singeing house is in the original <i>ostrina</i>, literally
purple, from <i>ostrea</i>, an oyster. But it seems to be
an error for <i>ustrina</i> (from <i>uro</i>) a burning or
conflagration (<i>Apuleius</i>) a place in which anything,
especially a dead body, has been burned (Festus),
or a melting house for metal (Pliny); but besides
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>these meanings of classic times, the word had
other mediæval significations, one of which is, a
place where hogs are singed—ubi porci ustulautur.
(See Ducange <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in voce</span></i>.) This seems to be the
most probable meaning of <i>ostrina</i> in the text.”
May not this be the “dryng-howses” named in
the will? The name of the family of Manchester
is not yet “spendit,” but is still borne both in this
country and in the United States.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>A Visitor to Lancashire in 1807.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>There are some interesting references to
Lancashire and the manufacturing district
in a volume of “Summer Excursions,” consisting
of letters written by Miss E. I. Spence, published
in 1809. Literary fame is not always permanent,
and it may be necessary to explain that the author
of these volumes and of “The Nobility of the
Heart” and “The Wedding Day” was a well-known
woman of letters in her own generation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Elizabeth Isabella Spence was the daughter of
a Durham physician, and the granddaughter of
Dr. Fordyce. She was early orphaned, and was
brought up in London by an uncle and aunt.
On their death the literary tastes which had
already made her a contributor to the press
became useful in the gaining of a subsistence.
She wrote nine novels or collections of stories,
and three works of inland travel, devoted respectively
to the North Highlands, Scotland, England,
and Wales. She “lodged for the greater part of
her life in a retired street at the west end of the
town”—Weymouth Street, that is. Amongst her
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>friends were the Benthams, Lady Margaret Bland
Burges, Lady Anne Barnard (the authoress of
“Auld Robin Gray”), Sir Humphrey Davy,
L. E. L., and the venerable Mary Knowles, one
of the few ladies who met Dr. Johnson on equal
terms in argument, and could even claim a victory
over that doughty champion. Miss Spence died
on the 27th July, 1832.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her impressions of the manufacturing district
were not of a favourable kind. The inns of
Warrington did not please her, and “the dirtiness
of the people here exceeds,” she says, “what I
could have believed in any part of this kingdom.”
From Bolton she writes: “The apparel of the
women in some of the villages we passed through
was scarcely decent, and all the children were
without shoes and stockings.” At Wigan she
mentions the “celebrated spa” and the “cannel
coal,” which was made into ornaments. “I have
heard a dinner service was once made out of this
coal, which, after the entertainment, was demolished
in the fire.” Bolton she found to be situated on
“a dreary moor,” but there was some compensation
in “an extensive view of a fine open country.”
The next stay was at Stand Hall, a mansion of
which the beautiful situation and the hospitality
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>of her friends, who were its inmates, made her
pardon even the rainfall. Her host, “Mr. J——,”
was Mr. John Johnson, steward for Lord Derby
in the Bury district. “The large town of
Manchester,” she says, “spreads along the valley
in front of the house at some miles’ distance, and
the less one of Bury is seen distinctly to the left,
surrounded by villages with simple cottages
dispersed along the plain. The hills of Lancashire,
Derbyshire, Cheshire, and Yorkshire, rising
in succession, spread in a vast amphitheatre till lost
in the immensity of space; while the rugged tops
of the Welsh mountains, which I gazed upon as
old friends, hide their heads in the clouds, of
which they seem to form a part. The dialect of
this country is peculiarly unharmonious to the ear,
and when spoken by the peasantry is scarcely to
be understood. All the lower orders of the people
are employed in the manufactories, and the dress
worn by the women is a long bed-gown, black
stockings, and a mob-cap hanging open from the
ears.” The fidelity of her description of the
former dress of the people will be recognised.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Spence was taken by her friends to the
Manchester theatre to see Mrs. Siddons as Lady
Macbeth, and also as Catharine in “Catharine
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>and Petruchio”—an adaptation of the “Taming
of the Shrew.” Apparently the drama then, as
now, was in a decline. “This pre-eminently great
actress,” says Miss Spence, “has for several years
been so entirely the theme of public admiration to
the real amateurs of the drama (for some we still
possess) that it would be superfluous to dwell on
her exquisite powers—powers that even in former
times, when the stage was in its meridian glory,
could not be excelled, and would have awakened
astonishment and admiration. But to give your
Ladyship” (the letter is addressed to the Dowager
Countess of Winterton) “an idea either of the little
taste or the prudent economy of the inhabitants of
Manchester in permitting her to perform to empty
benches, I need only mention that after the other
evening, on sharing the profits with the manager,
she was rewarded with the sum (shall I commit it
to paper?) of seven shillings!” But wishing to be
just, even in such a case, she adds, “There may,
indeed, have been a moral cause for this rather
than a want of taste or parsimony.” And no
doubt there were many in old Manchester who
would not go to the theatre even to see the acting
of Mrs. Siddons. In 1775, the establishment of a
Theatre Royal was advocated by a noble peer as
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>a means of “eradicating” Methodism in Manchester.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Spence visited also Rochdale, and was
impressed by the handsome houses of the manufacturers,
“whose wealth appears as unbounded as
the magnificence of their tables.” She notices
with regret the fondness for card parties, and was
surprised to find “the primitive hours of our
ancestors still prevalent in Rochdale,” where one
o’clock was the general dinner hour. Passing
through the “miserable village”—as she styles
it—of Whitworth, Miss Spence repeats an interesting
account of its famous “doctors,” which was
given to her by Mr. Johnson. “‘Old Sammie
[it should be Jammie] in Whitworth’ was originally
a common farrier, or cow doctor. His sons,
however, John and George, though they continued
the business of farriers, had a deal to do with the
human race, and for many years were famous for
the cure of cancers, and contracted or broken
limbs, which they frequently effected at a very
small expense, from the sum of two and sixpence
to half a guinea. T——, Bishop of Durham, was
a patient of theirs for a cancerous complaint;
and it is well known that they prolonged his life
for several months, though they did not cure him.
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>To this obscure village both lords and commoners
resort for relief; and in cancerous cases and
contractions have undoubtedly succeeded when
the regular bred men of the faculty have failed.
The widow of George, son of old Sammie, and
James, grandson of Sammie, are the present
doctors, and are held in high estimation for the
same cures. The widow of Doctor George is
reckoned very clever, and takes a most active part
amongst the patients of both sexes. They
attend once a week at Rochdale, where they
have a public open shop, and it is wonderful,
though dreadful, to see the business they go
through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The neighbourhood of Stand delighted her, and
she has a good word for the Rector of Prestwich
and for the Earl of Wilton. “What an edifying
example does my Lord Wilton set by attending
this church every Sunday, not only with the whole
of his noble family, but also in being followed by
the men and women of his household, who all
conduct themselves with the most becoming
reverence! This noble example of his Lordship
tends to assemble a very numerous and respectable
congregation, even from distant parts.” Some of
our readers will remember that at a later date
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>Fanny Kemble drew an interesting picture of the
household at Heaton Park. She was impressed
in the same manner as was Miss Spence, but she
does not give expression to it in quite the same
manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Adjoining to the mansion of Stand Hall,”
observes Miss Spence, “is a barn, which was
once a chapel. It has a fine Gothic roof of
English oak, and it is a singular fact, no one ever
saw a spider’s web upon it; and it always looks
as if it had just been swept down. Mr. J——
informed me no person he had ever met with
could account for it, although all other barns are
covered with spiders’ webs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Of Manchester she says, “It is a very large
town, but the streets, for the most part, are
inconveniently narrow, with very few noble
buildings or handsome houses. The population
is immense, and the traffic considerable; and it
has acquired great celebrity from its extensive
manufactories, so productive, all over the kingdom.”
We need only make one more quotation.
“I wish I could tell your Ladyship,” she says,
“that the peasantry were possessed of that native
simplicity we expect to find two hundred miles
from the Metropolis; their manners accord with
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>their rude and uncultivated appearance, and their
demeanour is remarkably forbidding; but this, I
understand, is often the case near manufacturing
towns, though it is the first time I have had the
opportunity of observing it.” Evidently Manchester,
even ninety years ago, was some distance
from Arcadia.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>How the First Spinning Machinery was taken to Belgium.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>The introduction of spinning machinery to
the Continent is a curious episode in the
history of commerce, and has some interest for
Manchester people, as it was from that place the
men and the machinery were obtained. The
industrial activity of England and the riches
which the inventions of Kay, Highs, and Arkwright
brought her, naturally attracted the attention
of her foreign rivals, but in those days there
were stringent regulations against the export of
machines, and the “seduction of artizans” to
engage in the service of a foreign master was a
criminal offence. The temptation was, however,
too great for the attempt not to be made. As
Englishmen had gone abroad in order to obtain
the secrets of the silk and other manufactures, so
foreigners came here to spy out the industrial
riches of the land. The man who succeeded in
taking abroad the spinning-jenny was Liévin
Bauwens.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> He belonged to a Belgian family that
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>claimed patrician rank, but had always been
associated with the industries of Holland, in
Antwerp, Malines, and other places. Although
the names and coat-of-arms of the Bauwens are to
be found in the books of the Low Country heralds,
they are also inscribed for generations in the
records of the Tanners’ Guild of Ghent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Liévin Jean Bauwens was born at Ghent on
the 14th of June, 1769, and was the son of
Georges Bauwens and his second wife, Thérèse
van Peteghem. His father had a tannery in the
Waaistraat, and his numerous children were
taught to take a part in the family industry, so
at an early age Liévin was made the overseer of
a branch establishment at Huydersvetters-Hoeck.
He can only have been a boy when he had this
responsible position, for at the age of sixteen he
came to London, and in the great tannery of
Undershell and Fox learned what there was to be
known of the English methods of that industry.
Three years later he returned to Ghent, and took
charge of a large establishment which his father
had started shortly before his death. The
Nieuwland Tannery in the old Dominican convent
employed 200 men, and kept 550 vats going.
Bauwens made leather for the London market,
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>and is said to have paid 500,000 francs of customs
duty yearly. He had frequent occasion to visit
England, and the expansion of the cotton industry
naturally attracted his attention—all the more so
that he had always had a strong taste for
mechanics, and only adopted the family trade in
compliance with the wishes of his father. A
clock which he had made at the age of twelve was
one of the favourite exhibits of his parents, who,
whilst proud of the ingenuity of their son, did not
wish him to abandon the vocation which had
ensured competence to the family. As tanners,
they naturally felt that there was “nothing like
leather.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this time Belgium was annexed to France,
and Bauwens proposed to the Directoire that he
should endeavour to obtain the secret of the
machines by which the British manufacturer bade
defiance to his continental rivals. The French
Government promised him their support, and he
came to Manchester for the purpose of getting the
necessary information. This was in 1798, and he
was aided by François de Pauw, one of his
relations. At Manchester he made the acquaintance
of an overseer, Mr. James Kenyon, and his
daughter Mary. Whilst talking business with the
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>father he appears to have talked of other matters
to the girl, who eventually became his wife. The
various parts of the machine, which in Belgium
came to be called the “mull jenny,” were secreted
in casks of sugar and in bags of coffee, and shipped
to Hamburg. The statement that he intended to
add dealings in colonial produce to his tanning
operations was a sufficient explanation of this
novel step on his part. Some of the packages
were to be sent from Gravesend, and from this
port Bauwens intended himself to depart, along
with a number of workmen whom he had engaged.
An overseer named Harding had a wife who
strongly objected to the departure of her husband,
and she made a scene, in which the destination
and intentions of the party were made known.
The police thus came to a knowledge of the
conspiracy, and the men were arrested. Bauwens
managed to escape in the crowd, and hastening
quickly to London, he took passage to Hamburg,
where part of the precious packages and the
workmen who had been sent on before awaited
him. Here he had a narrow escape, for Sir James
Crawford, the British Envoy, endeavoured to
have him imprisoned. The export of machinery
and workmen was then a criminal offence, and the
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>conspirators who had fallen into the hands of the
authorities were brought before the Court of
King’s Bench and convicted. The contemporary
accounts of the affair in the English periodicals
are very meagre, and the French accounts have
an air of exaggeration. Thus we are told that
Bauwens was, in his absence, condemned to death,
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faute de mieux</span></i> hung in effigy. Whatever
his sentence may have been, it was powerless to
hinder his success. He established spinning
factories at Ghent, and still larger establishments
at Paris, where he converted a convent of
Bonshommes, at Passy, into a cotton spinning mill.
He had a tannery at St. Cloud; he bought from
the French Government the ingots made from
the silver taken in the dissolved monasteries, and
sold them at considerable profit to the Bank
of Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c004'>Napoleon, when he came to power, had a good
opinion of Bauwens; he visited the great works
both at Paris and at Ghent, and after his inspection
of the last-named place, he sent 4,000 francs to
be distributed in presents to the workpeople.
Bauwens started a new spinning mill at
Tronchiennes, and was the first in Belgium to
employ steam power. The flying shuttle was
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>also used by him, and he made essays in cotton
printing, in carding, and, indeed, appears to have
been always on the alert for every possible
improvement of the industrial processes in which
he was engaged. He took an active part in local
affairs, and was <i>Maire</i> of Ghent and member
of the Council of the Department. In 1805, the
town of Ghent presented him with a gold medal
at a banquet, where the services of Bauwens in
the creation of fresh industries was gratefully
acknowledged. The French Institute, in a report
on the progress of industry, gave to Bauwens the
credit of having naturalised the English machines
in France. Napoleon, who was in Ghent in 1810,
offered him the title of Comte. This he declined,
but accepted the Cross of the Legion of Honour.
His great works, and that at Ghent, are said to
have given employment to 3,000 people, were
open to visitors, and he freely gave advice to
those who were engaging in the cotton trade.
His own profits were very large, and he showed
great liberality in the treatment of his workpeople,
and in the uses he made of his riches. But this
princely opulence was not without check. The
coalition of the great powers against Napoleon, in
1814, resulted in disaster to French industry, and
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>Bauwens was one of the victims. A forced sale
of the factories turned out very unfavourably,
and Bauwens was ruined.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the kingdom of the Netherlands was
formed, Bauwens sought the patronage of William
I., but in vain. A proposal to establish cotton
spinning on the banks of the Guadalquivir, which
he made to the Infanta of Spain, was equally unsuccessful.
In these circumstances he attempted
the creation of a new industry, and began at
Paris a process for the treatment of waste silk.
This was in 1819, and his partner, the Baron
Idelot de la Ferté, allowed him an annual salary
of 5,000 francs and a share of the profits. The
patent taken out in November, 1821, for the
preparation and treatment of silk floss, might
possibly have restored the fallen fortunes of
Liévin Bauwens, but he died of the rupture of an
aneurysm on the 17th of March, 1822. His
widow, the former Mary Kenyon, of Manchester,
after burying him in Père-la-Chaise, returned to
Belgium, and died at St. Bernard in 1834. Five
years later the two sons of the manufacturer
received the royal licence to use their father’s
Christian and surname as a patronymic. Liévin
was himself the eldest of a family of twelve. By
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>his marriage with Mary Kenyon he had two sons
and a daughter—Napoléon, born at Tronchiennes
in 1805, who died at Paris in 1869; Félix, born at
Tronchiennes in 1806, who died in London; and
Elvina Marie Bernardine, born at Tronchiennes
in 1809, who married M. Louis Rysheuvels, of
Antwerp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ghent has not forgotten the memory of the
man who laid the foundations of a vast industry,
and who united to commercial enterprise public
spirit and private generosity. One of her open
squares is named in honour of Liévin Bauwens,
and there his statute stands to witness that peace
has her victories no less than war. Such is one
of the many romantic episodes connected with the
history of the industrial development of Manchester.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Merry Andrew of Manchester.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>In that strange old joke-book, “Pasquil’s Jests
and Mother Bunches Merriments,” there is
a story in which a “local habitation” is given to
a name suggestive of grotesque amusement.
Whether the Mancunian Merry Andrew was
the first of his tribe may be doubted, but as the
book was printed in 1604, he is somewhat of
a patriarch in the race. The story is entitled,
“How merry Andrew of Manchester serued an
Vsurer,” and runs thus:—“Merry Andrew of
Manchester, who is well knowne, meeting with
three or foure of his companions on a Sunday,
presently hee bade them home to dinner, yet hee
neyther had meate nor money in his house. Well,
but to his shifts he goeth, and went into an olde
Usurer’s kitchen, where he was very familiar, and
priuily, under his gowne, he brought away the
pot of meate that was sodden for the old miser’s
dinner. When he came home, hee put out the
meat, and made his boy scoure the pot, and sent
him with it to the Usurer, to borrow two groats
on it, and bade the boy take a bill of his hand:
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>which the boy did, and with the money bought
beere and bread for their dinner. When the
Usurer should goe to dinner, his meat was gone;
wherefore he all to beat his mayd, calling her
whoore. She sayd ‘There came nobody but
Andrew there all that day.’ Then they asked
him; and he sayd, hee had none. But at last
they sayd, that he and no body else had the pot.
‘By my fayth,’ quoth Andrew, ‘I borrowed such
a pot on a time, but I sent it home agayne;’ and
so called his witnesse, and sayd: ‘It is perilous to
deal with men now adayes without writing; they
would lay theft to my charge, if I had not his
owne hand to showe;’ and so he shewes the
Usurers bill, whereat the Usurer storms, and all the
rest fell a laughing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There is another anecdote of this ancient droll,
but it is too indecorous to be repeated. The
story quoted occurs also, as Mr. Collier states,
in the <cite>Facetie, Motti e Burle</cite> (Venet. 1565) of
Domenichi (Bibliographical Account, ii., 124).</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c003'>About the beginning of the present century
there was resident in the neighbourhood
of Portland Street, Manchester, an elderly Irishwoman,
whose violent temper made her the terror
of the neighbourhood. The only person of whom
she stood in awe was the Roman Catholic priest,
Father Rowland Broomhead. She had a tender
side to her character, however, and her son, a wild
youth, having committed an offence, which in the
then barbarous state of the criminal law made liable
to be hanged, she undertook a journey to London;
walked the entire distance on foot, braved every
difficulty, and by her perseverance gained access
to Queen Charlotte, to whose motherly feelings
she made a strong appeal, and received a promise
that the life of her boy should be spared. He
was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death,
but in accordance with the royal promise he was
not hanged, but transported. This was told me
by one who in her youth had known the irascible
but true-hearted Irishwoman.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Some Lancashire Giants.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c003'>Like other parts of Old England, the
County Palatine has been distinguished
by great men, physically as well as mentally.
We begin with traditions of the former existence
of a race of the sons of Anak. Thus at Heathwaite,
in North Furness, two stone-circles are
known as “The Giants’ Graves.” A tradition
has of course been fitted to the name, and it
asserts that the last of these Lancashire Anaks
was shot by an arrow on the hill of Blawithknott.</p>

<p class='c004'>At Manchester the fame of the giant Tarquin,
who held a castle on the ford of the Medlock, was
long preserved. His legendary overthrow by Sir
Lancelot du Lake is recorded by Hollinworth,
and has since been turned into verse by one of
our local poets. The Rev. John Whitaker, the
learned historian of Manchester, discusses the
matter with becoming gravity, and is quite inclined
to believe in the reality of the gigantic
knight and the stalwart courage of Arthur’s hero
by whom he was overthrown. In the audit-room
of Chetham’s Hospital there is a grotesque boss
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>representing Saturn devouring his children, but
the juvenile guides used to describe it as a
portrait of Sir Tarquin enjoying his favourite
breakfast of a plump Manchester baby.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tombstone in the east cloister of Westminster,
which had on it the name of Gervasius
de Blois, but was thought by Dean Stanley to
cover the remains of Abbot Byrcheston and
twenty-six monks who died of the black death
in 1349, was at one time known as “Long Meg,”
and was said to be the gravestone of “Long Meg
of Westminster.” Long Meg of Westminster was
a Lancashire lass, who, according to the story-book,
came up to London with other country
wenches by the carrier’s waggon to seek service,
and she began her Metropolitan career by drubbing
the carrier for charging ten shillings each for
the ride to the great city. “The Life of Long Meg
of Westminster,” printed in 1635, contains many
particulars, but it has no good claims to authenticity.
“Dr. Skelton” is represented as the object
of her affections, and many curious anecdotes are
told of her prowess, and of the emphatic manner
in which she quelled the disturbances in the
Eagle, in Westminster, where she was servitor.
She volunteered for service when Henry VIII.
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>went to Boulogne, in place of a man who had
been impressed, and there behaved so stoutly as
to win a pension. But though an Amazon abroad
she was an obedient wife, and declined a bout
at quarter-staff with her husband. “Never shall
it be said, though I can swindge a knave that
wrongs me, that Long Meg shall be her husband’s
master; and therefore use me as you please.”
As all persons have their detractors, so this
“Lancashire lass” is said to have kept at Southwark
for many years “a famous infamous house
of open hospitality.” Those who desire to know
how the Lancashire lass overcame the vicar and
bailiff of Westminster, how she overthrew a
Spanish knight, fought with thieves, beat the
French at Boulogne, and performed many other
Amazonian exploits, may consult the “Life of
Long Meg,” which has been reprinted in the
present century. A ballad about her was licensed
in 1594, and in 1618 a play upon her exploits was
a favourite at the Fortune Theatre. Ben Jonson
describes her:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Or Westminster Meg,</div>
      <div class='line'>With her long leg,</div>
      <div class='line'>As long as a crane;</div>
      <div class='line'>And feet like a plane,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>With a pair of heels</div>
      <div class='line'>As broad as two wheels.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Amongst the proverbs cited by quaint old Fuller
is one current in the seventeenth century—“As
long as Meg of Westminster.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The most famous of the Lancashire giants is
the “Childe of Hale,” who was taken to Court
in 1620 and presented to James I. His patron
was Sir Gilbert Ireland, who “with some of the
neighbouring Lancashire gentry dizened him
off with large ruffs about his neck and hands; a
striped doublet of crimson and white, round his
waist, a blue girdle embroidered with gold; large
white plush breeches, powdered with blue flowers;
green stockings; broad shoes of a light colour,
having high red heels and tied with large bows
of red ribbon; and just below his knees were
bandages of the same colour, with large bows, and
by his side a sword, suspended by a broad belt
over his shoulder, and embroidered, as his girdle,
with blue and gold, with the addition of a gold
fringe upon the edge. We are traditionally
informed that his amazing size at the time frightened
away some thieves who came to rob his
mother’s house.” In this costume he is said to
have struggled with the King’s wrestler, whose
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>thumb he put out. This displeased some of
the courtiers, and hence the King dismissed him
with a present of £20. He returned home by
Brasenose College, Oxford, which was then full
of Lancashire students. Here, as we learn from
Harland, his portrait was taken of full life-size,
and is now to be seen in the College library.
There is another likeness of him preserved at
High Leigh; and an original painting of the
“Chylde” is kept in the gallery at Hale Hall,
bearing the following inscription:—“This is the
true portraiture of John Middleton, the ‘Chylde
of Hale,’ who was born at Hale, 1578, and was
buried at Hale, 1623.” About eighty years ago
the body is said to have been taken up, and
the principal bones were for some time preserved
at Hale Hall. The thigh bone, it is gravely
stated, reached from the hip of a common man to
his feet, and the rest measured in proportion.
After some time the bones were reburied in the
churchyard, but whereabouts is not known. He
could only stand upright in the centre of the
cottage in which he resided; and tradition states
that he attained his wonderful stature in one
night, in consequence of some spells and incantations
that were practised against him. The Rev.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>William Stewart, in his “Memorials of Hale,”
printed in 1848, says that “the cottage is now
inhabited by Mr. Thomas Johnson, and is situated
near the south-west corner of the Parsonage
Green. A descendant of his family, Charles
Chadwick, was living in 1804, and was more than
six feet high.” There is every appearance of
gross exaggeration in the accounts of the wonderful
“childe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>William Hone has given a portrait in the
“Every-day Book” of the “Manchester gigantic
boy,” exhibited at Bartholomew Fair, who was
fourteen years old and stood 5 feet 2 inches,
measured 5 feet round the body, 27 inches across
the shoulders, 20 inches round the arm, 24 inches
round the calf, 31 inches round the thigh, and
weighed 22 stone. Hone gives his name as
Whitehead, but William Wilkinson Westhead
appears to be his correct designation. He was
christened in the Collegiate Church 12th October,
1810, but is said to have been born in Glasgow.
Murphy, the Irish giant, who stood seven feet
and a half, and who died of small-pox at
Marseilles in the 26th year of his age, is said to
have begun life as a dock labourer at Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the other extremity may be mentioned
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>Boardman, the Bolton dwarf, who claimed to be
thirty-four years old, and to be only 38 inches in
height. The showman claims to have received the
patronage of the Royal Family at Ascot in 1819.
Doubtless further inquiry would greatly add to
these scattered notes of the Lancashire Anakim.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>A Note on William Rowlinson.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_6 c003'>A scrapbook made by William Rowlinson,
first exhibited at a meeting of
the Manchester Literary Club, and then liberally
presented by Mr. Charles Roeder to the Manchester
Free Library, is an interesting relic, and
may justify a note on this now forgotten but
promising young poet. It contains many newspaper
cuttings, the earliest pages being devoted
to his own compositions, and the remainder consisting
of miscellaneous matter, chiefly poetical,
that had attracted his attention.</p>

<p class='c004'>William Rowlinson was born in 1805, it is
believed, somewhere in the vicinity of Manchester.
The family removed, for a time, to
Whitby, but returned again to Manchester. He
must early have developed a passion for writing,
as contributions of his appear in the <cite>British
Minstrel</cite> in 1824. The <cite>British Minstrel</cite> was a
weekly periodical consisting of songs and recitations,
old and new. The number for November
20th, 1824, contains two lyrics by Rowlinson
(p. 171). The editor remarks, “We have received
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>a letter from Mr. Rowlinson, of Manchester, and
are obliged to him for the Originals enclosed.
Mr. Wroe, of Ancoats’ Street, is our bookseller at
Manchester; he, no doubt, will afford him every
facility in communicating with us at any time he
may have a packet for London.” A packet was
sent, and is acknowledged in the number for
December 25th, 1824. One of his lyrics appears
in the last number of the <cite>British Minstrel</cite>, which
came to an end January 22nd, 1825. His contributions
are—“I’ll come to Thee” (p. 171). “It
is not for Thine Eye of Blue” (p. 171). “Yes,
Thyrsa, Yes” (p. 194). “Farewell Land of My
Birth” (p. 197). “How Calm and Serene”
(p. 303). “Think not when My Spirits”
(p. 304). “Serenade” (p. 306). “Knowest
Thou My Dearest” (<a id='page' name='page'></a>p. 367). “How Sweet to Me”
(p. 369). A copy of this volume has been placed
in the Manchester Free Library by the present
writer.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the cessation of the <cite>British Minstrel</cite>, he
began, in January, 1825, to write for <cite>Nepenthes</cite>, a
Liverpool periodical. Still earlier, he is believed
to have contributed to the <cite>Whitby Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the age of eighteen to his death, at the
age of twenty-four, he was a frequent and a
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>welcome writer of prose and verse for the local
periodicals. His range was by no means limited;
he wrote art criticisms, essays in ethics, studies
of modern poets, and verse in various styles and
of varying quality. There is a musical flow about
his lyrics that shows a genuine poetic impulse, but
his talents had not time to ripen. His contributions
to <cite>Nepenthes</cite>, <cite>British Minstrel</cite>, <cite>Phœnix</cite>,
and <cite>Manchester Gazette</cite> have never been
collected, and it is too late for the task to be either
attempted or justified. An essay of his on
Drunkenness is reprinted in the <cite>Temperance Star</cite>
of May, 1890. The best of his poems is probably
“Sir Gualter,” which is quoted in Procter’s
“Literary Reminiscences” (p. 103). The same
charming writer has devoted some pages to his
memory in his “Memorials of Bygone Manchester”
(p. 161). One example, “Babylon,” is
given in Procter’s “Gems of Thought and
Flowers of Fancy” (p. 47), and four lyrics appear
in Harland’s “Lancashire Lyrics” (pp. 71-75).
One of these, “The Invitation,” was printed—with
another signature!—in the <cite>Crichton Annual</cite>,
1866. One of Rowlinson’s compositions—the
“Autobiography of William Charles Lovell”—is
said to be an account of his own experiences; this
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>I have not seen. The story of his life is brief. He
studied literature whilst earning his daily bread in
a Manchester warehouse. He was a clerk in the
employ of Messrs. Cardwell &amp; Co., Newmarket
Buildings, and to gratify his love of mountain
scenery, he has been known to leave the town on
Saturday night and walk to Castleton, in
Derbyshire, and, after spending the Sunday
there, walk home again through the night, to be
ready for his Monday morning task. Literature
did not wholly absorb him, for at twenty-four
years of age he was a husband, with a son and an
infant daughter. Early in 1829 he obtained a
more congenial position as a traveller for the firm
of Piggott, the famous compilers and publishers
of directories. This gave him the opportunity of
seeing Cambridge, where Kirke White is buried,
and other places, whose historic and literary
associations would appeal to his vivid imagination.
But whilst enjoying thoroughly the beautiful
scenery of the south, he pined for his northern
home. Whilst bathing in the Thames he was
drowned, June 22nd, 1829, and was buried in
Bisham churchyard, on the 25th.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>The Manchester Free Library has copies of
the exceedingly rare <cite>Phœnix</cite> and <cite>Falcon</cite>, with the
contributions of Rowlinson and others, identified
in MS. In the <cite>Phœnix</cite> “Bag-o-nails,” an
imitation of the “Noctes Ambrosianæ,” he
appears as Jeremiah Jingler. These periodicals,
and the scrapbook, make as complete a collection
of his scattered writings as is now possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>John Bolton Rogerson and R. W. Procter
have each borne affectionate testimony to the
moral worth and literary promise of William
Rowlinson. Soon after his death there appeared
in the <cite>Falcon</cite> some stanzas which declared,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The great in soul from his earthly home,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In his youthful pride hath gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the bards of old will proudly greet</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Muses’ honoured son.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh, there is joy in the blessed thought</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thou art shrin’d on fame’s bright ray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though the stranger’s step is on thy grave</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And thy friends be far away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>We need not cherish illusions. The stranger’s
step is on Rowlinson’s grave, but he is not
“shrined on fame’s bright ray,” whatever and
wherever that may be. No stone marks his
grave, his very resting-place is unknown; we
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>cannot even brush aside the grass from the
forgotten and moss-grown tomb of William
Rowlinson, one who perished in his early prime;
whose music, faint, yet melodious, passed into
silence before it could be shaped into a song the
world would care to hear or to remember.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Literary Taste of the Eighteenth Century.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>The literary tastes of our great-grandfathers
may be supposed to be mirrored in a
catalogue of the circulating library established
in the middle of the last century at Manchester.
The list of the subscribers includes the names of
Mr. Edward Byrom, the Rev. Mr. Ethelston,
Joseph Harrop, Titus Hibbert, Thomas Henry,
Dr. Peploe, Richard Townley, and Dr. C. White.
The late president of the Chetham Society had a
book-loving predecessor, for the name of Mr.
James Crossley is also in the list. The books
are of a highly respectable character, and impress
one with a favourable opinion of the pertinacity of
those who could pursue knowledge tinctured with
so slight a flavour of entertainment. Out of 452
books there are but twenty-two professing to be
novels, and amongst these are “Don Quixote,”
“Gil Blas,” “Devil upon Two Sticks,” “Sir
Charles Grandison,” “Tristram Shandy,” and
Sir Thomas More’s “Utopia.” The library had
faith in “Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem,” and
patronised “Poet Ogden,” who wrote “The
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>British Lion Roused.” Byrom, Deacon, and
Callcott were also amongst their local authors.
The readers who were tired of Mill’s “Husbandry”
and of the “Principles of the Quakers Truly
Represented,” might turn to Voltaire’s “Letters
Concerning the English Nation,” or amuse themselves
with Glanvill’s examination of “The
Opinion of Eastern Sages Concerning the Pre-existence
of Souls;” and if the daughter of the
house obtained by chance the heterodox treatise
which declares “Christianity as Old as the
Creation,” she might have it changed for the
“Young Misses’ Magazine,” or, still better, the
“Matrimonial Preceptor.” Another fine avenue
for the satisfaction of polite curiosity would be
afforded by the study of the wonderful work in
which Tobias Swinden discourses at large on the
“Nature and Place of Hell,” and proves to his
own satisfaction that “the fire of hell is not
metaphorical but real,” and shows “the probability
of the sun’s being the local hell.” At the end of
the catalogue is an advertisement of a proposed
musical circulating library, in which the neglect of
church music is affirmed; “and if we continue
our present fondness for things in the sing-song
way, ’tis great odds but our present taste will be
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>entirely changed, and, like some of our modern
religious sects, we shall be so distressed as to rob
the stage and playhouse to support and enrich our
churches.” This is supported by a reference to
“the Methodists, as they are call’d,” and their use
of song tunes. The volume contains supplementary
lists of additions down to June, 1768. These
include the first edition of Chaucer and “The
Vicar of Wakefield,” then in the early flush of
fame. For the members not satisfied with
Glanvill’s speculations, there had been added
Berrow’s “Lapse of Human Souls in a State of
Pre-existence,” and the studious character of the
Mancunians received a delicate compliment by
the purchase of Tissot’s “Treatise on the Diseases
Incident to Literary Persons.” The additional
subscribers included Mr. Nathaniel Philips, Rev.
Mr. Dauntesey, and the Rev. John Pope. The
number of works in the library in June, 1768, was
586, representing perhaps twice that number of
volumes.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Hugh of Manchester:<br /> <br />A Statesman and Divine of the Thirteenth Century.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c003'>“Let me be the remembrancer,” says Fuller
when describing the worthies of Lancashire,
“that Hugh of Manchester in this county
wrote a book in the reign of King Edward the
First, intituled, ‘De Fanaticorum Deliriis’ (Of
the Dotages of Fanatics). At which time an
impostor had almost made Eleanor the queen-mother
mad, by reporting the posthume miracles
done by her husband, King Henry the Third,
till this our Hugh settled her judgment aright. I
could wish some worthy divine (with such
Lancashire doth abound) would resume this
subject, and shew how ancient and modern
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>fanatics, though differing much in their wild
fancies and opinions, meet together in a mutual
madness and distraction.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The historians of Lancashire have generally
followed Fuller in regarding Hugh of Manchester
as a native of the county, but there is nothing
to identify him with certainty, for his name may
be referred alike to Lancashire or to Warwickshire,
and the tests that can now be applied
are not decisive. The pedigree in Dugdale’s
“Warwickshire” does not show our churchman,
though there is a Hugh de Mancestre who was
one of the justices of Warwickshire 29, 30, 31,
and 32 of Henry III. In the thirty-sixth year of
that King he had a grant of free warren. He
was then coroner for the county and next year
escheator. He died 37 Henry III., leaving two
sons, Simon and Walter. There is no place
assigned to Hugh in this genealogy, but even if
he belonged to the stock he may have been a
collateral relative or he may have been omitted as
a member of a religious order having theoretically
no further interest in worldly affairs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The date of his birth is unknown. Fuller,
following the authority of Pits, says that he was,
“when <i>Adolescens</i> [a youth], a Dominican; but
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>when <i>Juvenis</i> [a young man] he changed his
copy, and turned a Franciscan. Say not he
degraded himself, choosing a later order then
he left; for it seems that amongst them the last
is counted the best, as of a more refined
perfection. He was a great scholar, and highly
esteemed in that age for his severity and
discretion.” He was a Doctor of Divinity and
Professor of Theology, and afterwards Provincial
of the Franciscan Order in England. The most
interesting incident in his life is that already
named, and which led to the production of that
one of his works which is most frequently named.
The death of Henry III., in 1272, removed a
good man but an incompetent monarch from
a world where moral excellence does not supply
the deficiency of administrative ability. But the
rule of not speaking evil of the dead led some
after Henry’s death to invest his memory with
a sanctity that approached to a popular canonization.
We may again quote Fuller, who is
relying upon the authority of Bale: “An
impostor happened at this time, pretending
himself first blind, then cured at the tomb of
King Henry the Third, so to get coin to himself,
and credit to the dead King. But our Hugh
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>discovered the cheat; and, writing a book, ‘De
Fanaticorum Deliriis,’ dedicated it to King
Edward the First, who kindly accepted thereof,
preferring that his father’s memory should
appear to posterity with his true face, than
painted with such false miracles.” It is a matter
of regret that this book has not survived; since it
is creditable to an age when superstition too often
conceded an unwarranted belief in baseless
claims. That Hugh of Manchester had the
skill to detect the imposture is honourable to his
intellect, and Edward I. must be commended
for the candour that rewarded the scholar who
had dispersed from the kingly father some of
that odour of sanctity with which ignorance had
surrounded his memory.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is an interesting reference to Hugh of
Manchester in a letter sent by Archbishop John
Romanus to Friar William de Hotham, who was
afterwards Bishop of Dublin. This epistle is
dated 10th December, 1293, and is printed in
“Historical Papers and Letters, from the
Northern Registers,” edited by James Raine
(London, 1873, p. 102):—</p>

<p class='c015'>“For his (son, Romanus, Archbishop) wisheth safety,
grace, and blessing. Since in our recess at Wilebrigg
you said that, being about to hold converse with Brother
Hugh of Manchester, you would point out to us some
matters for consideration, we, for your love proved by
manifold experience, make known to you by means of
this writing, that, just as we said by living voice, about that
document sent from Schardeburgh on the occasion of
certain falsehoods imposed upon us by the Friars
and Minors, whatsoever we can with honesty, and under
the dictates of conscience, we will do for you. But
because, as you know, we are in our profession firmly
bound to the observation of the canons, nothing dare we
attempt against the general constitution. And because
our argument itself has not been heard, and because you
have not wished to respond to what had been only half
stated; we write for you the argument itself, in order that
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>you may be able to satisfy us by letter. And the
argument is this. Let us suppose that parish priests
are bound to administer their cure of souls thus.
Whoever is bound to administer a cure of souls is bound
to know the face<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> of his flock. But he cannot thoroughly
know the face of his flock unless by hearing the
confession of him under his care. Therefore, he who is
bound to administer a cure of souls is bound to hear the
confession of him who is under his care; and we believe
it was for that reason that to every body, of either sex, a
peculiar constitution was given. But you say that they
who confess to your Friars and Minors are not bound
to confess to their own proper priest. Therefore their own
priest is not bound to hear their confession. But if he
is not bound to hear their confession, he is not bound to
know their face. Therefore, to the destruction of the
conclusion of the argument, he is not bound to administer
his cure of souls. But according to the hypothesis in
the beginning of the argument he is bound to administer
his cure of souls. Therefore he is bound, and he is not
bound, to administer his cure of souls. But these things
are contradictory. And, if I may use the words of our
venerable teacher Augustine, which occur in the first
book concerning the Trinity: ‘It will not,’ he says,
‘be irksome to me thus to inquire wherever I hesitate,
nor shame me thus to learn wherever I err. Whoever,
therefore, hears or reads these words, let him, when
he is equally certain, cleanse himself as I do; when
he is equally doubtful, let him go with me and ask;
when he knows his error, let him return to me; when
he recalls me to himself let us walk together the way of
charity, leading towards Him of Whom it has been
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>written, ‘Seek ye always His face.’ And because in the
constitution of [Pope] Martin these words are contained,
‘And we wish that these people who confess to the Friars,
the same may be bound nevertheless to confess to their
own parish priests, once in the year, according to the
statute of the general council; and that the Friars diligently
and efficaciously exhort them, according to the grace given
them by the Lord,’ so we said in the afore-mentioned
attestation that the Friars can, according to the nature
of their privilege, enjoin upon those confessing to them,
or advise and persuade them, that once in a year
they confess to their own priest. In so far as what we
have said differs from the privilege, we shall be prepared,
if it please you, to revoke it. Fare ye well. Dated at
Wycomb, IIII Ides of December in the 8th year of our
pontificate.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The latest mention we have of Hugh of Manchester
is in connection with his work as an
ambassador. He was sent in 1294, in company
with William of Gainsburgh, to demand on behalf
of Edward III. the restitution of the lands
claimed by the English King, but retained by
force in the hands of Philip of France. On this
appointment Fuller quaintly remarks: “Such
who object, that fitter men than friars might have
been found for that service, consider not how in
that age such mortified men were presumed the
most proper persons peaceably to compromise
differences between the greatest princes.” There

of Brunne’s “Chronicle”:—</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Mrs. Fletcher in Lancashire.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>In the autobiography of Mrs. Fletcher, who
was for many years a conspicuous figure in
Edinburgh society, there are some interesting
references to Lancashire people.</p>

<p class='c004'>Eliza Dawson was born at Tadcaster in 1770,
and came of good yeoman stock, from whom she
inherited a steady-going Liberalism that equally
avoided the extremes of “divine right” either of
kings or mobs. The beauty and good nature of
the girl attracted admiration even in her school
days, and she had to reduce several worthy
young men to temporary despair by the rejection
of their proposals of marriage. Mr. Fletcher, who
became her husband, was twenty years her senior,
and fell in love with her because she realized his
ideal of Sophia Western in “Tom Jones”! He
was a well-known Edinburgh lawyer, and in her
new home she met Scott, Jeffery, and Brougham.
Later she made the acquaintance of Wordsworth,
Southey, Arnold, Lafeyette, Mrs. Gaskell,
Mazzini, Kossuth, and a variety of other
distinguished persons. Her husband died in
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>1838, but she survived for thirty years. Her
latter days were spent at Grasmere, where she
died in 1858. The impression made by this
gifted woman upon those with whom she came in
contact is vividly shown by the description which
Margaret Fuller has left of her. “Seventy-six
years have passed over her head, only to prove
in her the truth of my theory that we need never
grow old. She was ‘brought up’ in the
animated and intellectual circle of Edinburgh,
in youth an apt disciple, in her prime a bright
ornament of that society. She had been an only
child, a cherished wife, an adored mother,
unspoiled by love in any of these relations,
because that love was founded on knowledge.
In childhood she had warmly sympathised in the
spirit that animated the American Revolution,
and Washington had been her hero; later, the
interest of her husband in every struggle for freedom
had cherished her own. She had known in
the course of her long life many eminent men,
and sympathised now in the triumph of the people
over the corn laws, as she had in the American
victories, with as much ardour as when a girl,
though with a wiser mind. Her eye was full of
light, her manner and gesture of dignity; her
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>voice rich, sonorous, and finely modulated; her
tide of talk marked by candour and justice, showing
in every sentence her ripe experience and her
noble genial nature. Dear to memory will be
the sight of her in the beautiful seclusion of her
home among the mountains, a picturesque, flower-wreathed
dwelling, where affection, tranquillity,
and wisdom were the gods of the hearth to whom
was offered no vain oblation. Grant us more such
women, time! Grant to men to reverence, to seek
for such!”</p>

<p class='c004'>She owed much of her religious feeling to the
influence of the Rev. John Clowes. “It was in
the winter of 1788 that I met, at the house of the
Misses Hutton (two excellent maiden ladies) at
Tadcaster, the Rev. John Clowes, rector of St.
John’s Church, in Manchester. The bond between
these pious and primitive old ladies and
Mr. Clowes was, I believe, their mutual admiration
of the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg.
Although I could not participate in their enthusiasm
for that visionary writer, I think it was
from Mr. Clowes’s conversation and writings
that I first became interested in the spiritual
sense of true religion, or, in other words, felt
its experimental truth; and I wish here to
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>preserve the following transcript of the conversation
which I made from memory after
passing the evening with Mr. Clowes at Miss
Hutton’s. Several ladies, some of the Methodist
persuasion, were present. His views have always
appeared to me to contain much of the true
spirit of Christianity. Being asked his opinion
of Mr. Law’s works, Mr. Clowes said, ‘I read
them, madam, with great diligence and much
affection, and I found that they tended to produce
a pure, holy, and peaceable frame of mind,
but I found likewise that they disqualified a man
for the duty of his calling. I could not even
go to perform my duty in the church without
finding something to disturb me. This made me
conjecture that all was not right in Mr. Law’s
doctrine, and I conceive it to be this: that it is
admirably suited for the contemplative but not for
the active life of man, inasmuch as it does not
bring the outward man into entire subjection to
the inner man, for man has two lives, or two
beings, in his very best state while on earth.’...
When asked what he conceived to be the state of
the blessed, he replied in a calm, but animated
tone of voice, ‘I conceive the state of the blessed
to be a total forgetfulness or absence of <em>self</em>, and
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>to consist in beholding the good and happiness of
others, so that every individual will enjoy the
whole happiness of heaven.’... Every
man is according to his own desire, for assuredly
the Lord wills the good and happiness of all His
creatures. If a man says he desires to be better,
and that he is unhappy because his desire is not
fulfilled, let not that man be impatient; he has
begun to bear his cross, and if he bears it
patiently, humbly waiting for a better state, he
will certainly obtain his desire. The good he did,
because he saw it was commanded, will soon be
his delight; and to delight in good is the temper
and disposition of angels.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In the year 1808, during a visit to Lancashire,
her friend, Miss Kennedy, made her acquainted
with the family of Mr. Greg, at Quarry Bank.
“We stayed a week with them, and admired the
cultivation of mind and refinement of manners
which Mrs. Greg preserved in the midst of a
money-making and somewhat unpolished community
of merchants and manufacturers. Mr.
Greg, too, was most gentlemanly and hospitable,
and surrounded by eleven clever and well-educated
children. I thought them the happiest family group
I had ever seen. Miss Kennedy also took me to
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>visit her friends, the Rathbone family, at Green
Bank, near Liverpool, and we there met Mr.
Roscoe, the elegant-minded author of the ‘Life of
Lorenzo de’ Medici.’ Mr. Roscoe took us to his
beautiful residence at Ollerton Hall, and charmed
us by the good taste of his varied and agreeable
powers of conversation. He had been returned
member for Liverpool during the Whig Ministry
of 1806, and both he and Mr. Rathbone had
taken a decided part in the cause of the abolition
of the slave trade. We were taken to see the
last ship which had sailed from the port of
Liverpool for trade in human beings. It was
then undergoing a change for the stowage of
other goods than those wretched negroes who had
formerly been crammed in the space between
decks not more than four feet high. The iron
hooks remained to which they had been chained.
It was a sickening sight,—but those chains were
broken. We stayed some days at Green Bank,
where we enjoyed the society of the venerable
William Rathbone, the zealous friend of civil
and religious liberty. It was he, and Mr. Roscoe,
and Dr. Currie, who by their personal influence
and exertions established the first literary and
philosophical society at Liverpool, and induced
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>their fellow-townsmen to think and feel that there
were other objects besides making money which
ought to occupy the time and thoughts of reasonable
beings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. W. E. Forster, on a visit to Mrs. Fletcher,
brought with him “Mary Barton,” which had
then only just appeared, and was still anonymous.
Mrs. Fletcher says:—“We were at once struck
with its power and pathos, and it was with
infinite pleasure I heard that it was written by
the daughter of one whom I both loved and
reverenced in my early married life in Edinburgh,
so that I had a two-fold pleasure in making
Mrs. Gaskell’s acquaintance through Miss M.
Beever, who knew her at Manchester, and who
told me that she always asked about me with
interest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She visited Liverpool again in February, 1848,
where Mrs. Rathbone, of Green Bank, introduced
her to that worthy Irishwoman, “Catharine of
Liverpool,” whose history is one of the romances
of poverty.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>In 1851 she was in Manchester, and after
dining with Mrs. Gaskell, went to hear Kossuth
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>in the Free Trade Hall. She was delighted
with the orator, pleased with the crowd, who
considerately made way for the white-haired old
gentlewoman, and impressed by the interest in
foreign politics shown by “this great town of
Manchester.” Next morning at breakfast she
met Thomas Wright, the prison philanthropist,
then a hale man of sixty-six.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her autobiography was edited by her daughter,
Lady Richardson, and published in 1875 by
Edmondston &amp; Douglas. Another edition appeared
in the United States in 1883.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Fletcher had not only ability, but the
subtler gift of sympathy. She had an instinctive
feeling for that which was beautiful alike in the
spheres of literature and morals.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Manchester and the First Reform Agitation.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>The reform agitation began in Manchester
in 1792, and its history is instructive and
too little known by the present generation. The
town, which was heartily Republican in the Civil
Wars, was as heartily Jacobite in the earlier part
of the eighteenth century, and in its closing years
was dominated by the sworn friends of intolerance
and privilege. The vainly proposed repeal in
1789 of the Corporation and Test Acts, by which
the Nonconformists were excluded from all
municipal offices, led to the formation in Manchester
of a “Church and King Club,” whose
members showed their loyalty by deep potations
and their piety by wearing buttons which bore a
representation of the “Old Church.” An era of
bitter party feeling now set in. Those who were
Dissenters, those who were suspected of thinking
that Manchester and other important manufacturing
towns should be represented in Parliament,
those who ventured to regard the sale of
pocket-boroughs as a scandal, those who hinted
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>that any improvement was possible in the constitution
of a Parliament that was notoriously
non-representative and that included many members
who owed their position to improper and
corrupt influences, were marked out for social
ostracism and persecution. The Liberals of that
day banded themselves together and formed the
Manchester Constitutional Society, which in May,
1792, set forth as one of its objects that “members
of the House of Commons should owe their
seats to the good opinion and free suffrage of the
people at large, and not to the prostituted votes
of venal and corrupt boroughs.” The Government
immediately issued a proclamation against “wicked
and seditious writings,” and called upon the
magistrates to take rigorous action. The King’s
birthday was celebrated by illuminations, and the
partisans of the “glorious Constitution,” which
denied them the rights of citizenship, tore up a
couple of the trees growing in St. Ann’s Square,
and tried to batter down the gates of the Unitarian
chapels in Cross Street and Mosley Street. The
publicans were warned that their licences would
be forfeited if they allowed any gatherings of the
reformers upon their premises. No less than 186
of them signed an agreement to that effect, and in
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>some of the taverns was a conspicuous announcement,
“No Jacobins admitted here.” The war
with France was hailed with delight by the
adherents to the old order, and was deeply
deprecated by the reformers. A man of great
talent, Thomas Cooper, issued an address on the
evils of war, and this, with other dissuasives,
appeared in the <cite>Manchester Herald</cite>, a newspaper
which the reformers had started. Encouraged by
the authorities of the town, a drunken mob
attacked the printing office and sacked it. The
Rev. J. Griffith declared that he would not act
against the rioters if called upon to do so, and a
special constable offered the mob a guinea for
“every Jacobin’s house that they pulled down.”
A friend of the printer’s applied to the constable
for help, and was answered by a threat of being
kicked out of the place. The leader of the
reformers was Mr. Thomas Walker, and his
house also was selected for attack. He and his
friends defended the place with firearms. The
conduct of the rioters was defended by Wyndham
in the House of Commons, and a prosecution was
instituted, not against the law-breakers, but
against Mr. Walker. He had firearms in his
possession, and therefore he had “obtained arms
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>to wage war against the King.” The case came
on at the Lancaster Spring Assizes, but the
principal witness proved himself to be a shuffling
perjurer, and Law, afterwards Lord Ellenborough,
saw the matter to be so hopeless that he threw up
the case. Thomas Cooper left the town for
America, where he obtained high distinction as a
chemist, jurist, and political economist. The
reformers were helpless and almost hopeless.
The war fever had seized the nation; the right of
public meeting and the freedom of the press were
the subject of constant attack. The law against
seditious assemblies was used as a means of
prohibiting any public expression of disapprobation
of the state of the Constitution or the acts of the
Government. It was denounced by Charles James
Fox, and a very whimsical protest was made
against it in Manchester, which is thus described
in a newspaper of the time:—“On Monday
evening (28th December, 1796), the members
of the Manchester Thinking Club commenced
their first mental operation by beginning
to think, or in other words, submitting
themselves like good subjects to a constitutional
dumbness. The number of thinkers assembled
was not less than 300, and many of the thoughtful
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>actually came from Liverpool, Stockport, and
other remote places to witness this novel spectacle.
The members were all muzzled, and such an
imposing silence prevailed for one hour as would
have done honour to the best thinkers that ever
adorned assemblies of a more dignified nature.
The word ‘Mum’ appeared in large characters
on every muzzle, and except a seditious sigh or a
treasonable groan that occasionally broke forth,
‘Mum’ was literally the order of the night.” Here
is an advertisement of the meetings of the “Thinking
Club”:—“The members of this truly constitutional
Society continue to meet for the intellectual
purpose of silent contemplation every Thursday
evening, at the Coopers’ Arms, Cateaton Street,
where strong constitutional muzzles are provided
at the door by Citizen Avery, tailor to the swinish
multitude. The questions still to be thought of
are: Is man really a thinking animal or not? and
if he is, as thinking is rather a troublesome operation
of the mind, ought he not to be thankful that
his betters kindly think for him? The chair to be
taken at half-past seven. Thinking to begin
precisely at eight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But war brought its usual concomitant of want,
and the sufferings of the people led to deep-seated
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>discontent. The weavers called a meeting for
the 24th of May, 1808, to ask for the establishment
of a minimum rate of wages. The meeting
was resumed on the following day, and although
it was quite orderly, the Riot Act was read, and
the military were ordered to clear the ground.
One of the weavers was killed, several were
wounded, and several arrested. Colonel Hanson,
the commander of a local volunteer corps, tried
to persuade the men to disperse by a promise
that their interests should be looked after. This
was giving “encouragement to the rioters,” and
for this he was sentenced to a fine of £100 and
six months’ imprisonment in the King’s Bench.
Meanwhile the policy of the Government increased
the distress of the nation, so that in the cotton
districts the people were half-starved, and a scanty
dinner of oatmeal and water was too often the
only meal in the four and twenty hours. A
town’s meeting was called for 8th April, 1812, to
thank the Regent for retaining the Anti-Reform
Ministry of Castlereagh and Sidmouth. The
reformers immediately issued placards calling
upon the public to attend. The promoters of the
meeting, alarmed at the thought of opposition,
now announced that it would not be held, as the
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>staircase was too weak to sustain the pressure of
a crowd. People assembled for the expected
meeting, and the Exchange was soon surrounded.
No authentic account of the beginning of the riot
has appeared, but the present writer was informed
by an eye-witness that the last touch was put to
the anger of the populace by a merchant who
afterwards made himself an evil reputation. He
was standing at the door of the Exchange, and as
a chimney-sweep passed by he struck the lad’s
black face with his walking-cane. The populace
forced their way into the room, the furniture was
destroyed, the windows broken, and the military
had to be called out before the place was cleared.
This was followed during the next fortnight by
food riots and by machine breaking. The
authorities, instead of seeing in the existing
discontent the symptoms of evils needing remedy,
treated every expression of a desire for reform as
a crime to be punished with merciless severity.
Spies were actively at work fanning the disaffection
of the operatives in order to betray them
if they could be inveigled into illegality. In 1815,
the Corn Law was passed whilst the House of
Commons was guarded by soldiers. The Manchester
meeting held to protest against its
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>passage was presided over by Mr. Hugh Hornby
Birley, who was then Boroughreeve. In 1815, a
number of the Radical reformers, chiefly of the
artisan class, resolved to adopt an address to the
Prince Regent and a petition to the House of
Commons in favour of peace and Parliamentary
reform. They met at the Elephant, in Tib
Street, but hearing that the meeting was likely to
be broken up they adjourned to the Prince
Regent’s Arms, in Ancoats. John Knight, who
was their recognised leader, had just concluded a
speech when the room was entered by the famous
“Jo” Nadin with a blunderbuss in his hands, and
followed by a number of soldiers with fixed bayonets.
The reformers were arrested and marched,
with their hands tied, to the New Bailey.
They were taken before the Rev. W. R. Hay,
who, with the gross partiality for which he was
notorious, refused to allow Fleming, the spy-witness,
to be cross-examined. They were tried
at Lancaster in the following August, when
Nadin, the constable, admitted that he had sent
Fleming as a decoy, and that the spy had asked
to be “twisted in”—that is, to be sworn as a
member of a seditious society. All who were found
in the room were included in the common indictment,
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>and thus could not testify in each other’s
behalf. Fortunately Nadin had been too precipitate,
and one man escaped his notice. He testified
that no oath had been administered, and it was
further shown that the two men said to have put
the oath to the spy were elsewhere at the time.
The thirty-seven prisoners were defended by
Brougham and Scarlett, and triumphantly acquitted.
They had, however, been in prison for three
months, they had been taken from their homes
and daily avocations, and it was by the merest
good luck that they had escaped transportation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The writings of William Cobbett had great
influence upon the working classes, and his
incessant cry for reform met with sympathetic
response. The Sunday schools had given elementary
instruction to the stronger brains, and
native shrewdness, tutored by suffering and hardship,
had made them into intelligent politicians.
They knew where the shoe pinched, and in spite
of some errors of judgment had a clearer conception
than their “betters” of the remedy. Sam
Bamford, the weaver-poet, was the secretary of a
political club at Middleton for Parliamentary
reform as a means of obtaining the repeal of the
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>Corn Laws and other desirable objects, and
similar clubs existed all over the county.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1816, the Ministers suspended the Habeas
Corpus Act, and took other measures for burking
public discussion. At the “blanketeer” meeting,
held at St. Peter’s Fields, 10th March, it was
decided that the men should march to London to
petition, each with a blanket on his shoulder for
protection from cold in the night. The meeting
was dispersed by the military, many were arrested,
and those who had started on their way to the
Metropolis were pursued. The “blanketeers”
were overtaken on Lancashire Hill, Stockport,
where more were arrested, more wounded, and
where one cottager was shot at his own door. It
is only fair to the military to state that they showed
far more moderation than the magistrates. A few
of the “blanketeers” reached Derby. The spies
were now at work, and Bamford tells how one of
these invited him to join in making a “Moscow of
Manchester.” The muddle-headed authorities
accepted without inquiry all that their infamous
agents told them, and after the arrest of Bamford
and others at Ardwick, the Rev. W. R. Hay
assured his awe-struck hearers that when these
men were tried “purposes of the blackest enormity
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>must be disclosed to the public.” After being
taken in irons to London—one of them being an
old man of seventy-four—and examined by the
Secretary of State, they were discharged, and not
even put upon their trial. Yet this “plot” was
the chief argument used by Sidmouth for a further
suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. Castlereagh
cynically avowed that they had sent Oliver
the spy “to see what was going on.” The
Lancashire men were warned in time, and Oliver,
though he tried hard, had no success here. In
Derbyshire, however, he fomented an “insurrection,”
and those whom he had first incited to
sedition he afterwards betrayed to the scaffold.
In 1818, the Manchester reformers sent a petition
to the House of Commons, in which they asserted
that there never had been in this neighbourhood
any reason for the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus Act, denounced the work of the spies,
and asked for an inquiry into the action of the
magistrates at Manchester. Bamford and others
who had been arrested also petitioned; but Mr.
George Philips’s motion for an inquiry by a Committee
of the House of Commons was rejected by
162 votes against 69, and the Ministry obtained
an Act of indemnity for all their proceedings. Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>John Greenwood managed to exclude the name of
Mr. J. E. Taylor from the list of the Salford
assessors because he was a moderate reformer,
and asserted that he had written a handbill leading
to the destruction at the Exchange in 1812. Mr.
Taylor, unable to obtain any retraction or explanation,
denounced him as “a liar, a slanderer, and
a scoundrel.” For this an action for libel was
begun. Mr. Taylor defended himself, and the
jury came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was
“a liar, a slanderer, and a scoundrel.” Mr.
Taylor’s acquittal was chiefly due to the foreman
of the jury, Mr. John Rylands, of Warrington,
who, resolutely putting aside all legal cobwebs,
declined to punish a man for telling the truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The year 1819 was an important one for the
cause of reform. There was a meeting in St.
Peter’s Fields in June, when the people, to
embarrass the Government, decided to abstain
from excisable articles as far as possible. Roasted
corn was to take the place of coffee, sloe leaves to
be substituted for tea, and the use of spirits and
ale was to be abandoned. The “loyal” inhabitants
placarded the town with incentives to
drinking, and an attempt was made to pay for
this poster out of the church rates. The people
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>had lost hope of obtaining reform by petition, and
the notion was broached of appointing a representative
to claim a seat in the House of Commons.
The reformers of Manchester therefore called a
meeting for the purpose of electing “a legislatorial
attorney and representative” for the town. This
assembly was called for August 9th, but the
magistrates declared that it would be illegal, and
the intention was abandoned. The reformers
then presented a requisition, signed by 700 householders,
asking the Boroughreeve to call a town’s
meeting. He refused to do so, and it was then
decided to hold an open-air meeting in St. Peter’s
Fields for the purpose of petitioning for a reform
in Parliament. The reformers from all parts of
Lancashire were expected to be there, and at
Middleton and elsewhere they were drilled into
the proper method of marching so that there
might be no confusion. The authorities professed
to regard these harmless marchings with sticks
and broom handles as the presages of revolution.
The procession that filed into St. Peter’s Fields
on the morning of the 16th August, 1819, was
largely composed of young men and young women
of the artisan class, dressed out in their Sunday
best. They had many flags with them. There
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>were from sixty to eighty thousand people present
to give a welcome to Henry Hunt, whose handsome
form and power of speech made him at
that time the idol of the Lancashire workmen.
Loud were the cheers of the multitude as he rode
up to the hustings—which had been placed where
is now the south-east corner of the Free Trade
Hall. The white hats—then the symbol of
Radicals—were waved in the air, the men
hurrahed, and the women smiled as the hero of
the hour approached. The magistrates, perhaps
honestly alarmed, but weak and vacillating, now
determined to arrest the ringleaders in the face of
the assembled multitude. There was not the
slightest occasion to fear any riot or disturbance,
and active precautions had been taken to overawe
the reformers. On the field, in readiness for
action, were six troops of the 15th Hussars, a
troop of Horse Artillery with two guns, part of
the 21st Regiment of Infantry, some companies
of the 88th Regiment, above 300 of the Cheshire
Yeomanry, and about forty members of the Manchester
Yeomanry—sworn foes of reform. As
the immense multitude listened in intense silence
to the opening sentences of Hunt’s speech,
the Manchester Yeomanry, under the command
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>of Mr. H. H. Birley, appeared on the outskirts
of the crowd, and were received with shouts.
Without one word of warning they set their
horses in a gallop, and with their bright swords
flashing in the air, they dashed into the crowd,
striking right and left with their sabres with
all the energy of madmen. They became
scattered over the field, and were literally wedged
into the palpitating mass of humanity which they
were attacking. The Hussars were now ordered
to the attack, and for the most part drove the
people with the flat of the sword, but the edge
also was used. When the yeomanry were
extricated they wheeled round and dashed again
into the crowd wherever there was an opening,
cutting and slashing at all who came before them.
In many parts the panic-stricken crowd was
literally piled up in heaps. For attending a
perfectly peaceable meeting to ask for a reform in
Parliament, which had then no representatives of
the great towns, and was largely filled by the
owners of pocket-boroughs and their nominees,
for thus asserting their rights as Englishmen to
discuss their grievances, ten men and one woman
were killed and 600 were wounded. The man
chiefly responsible for this slaughter was the Rev.
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>W. R. Hay, who is said to have read the Riot
Act from a neighbouring window, but, if so, did it
in such a manner that it was never heard by
the crowd. The peaceful nature of the assembly
was shown by the number of women and of old
men who were in it. Poor old Thomas Blinstone,
at the age of 74, was rode over by the yeomanry,
and had both arms broken, and said he, “What
is wur than aw, mester, they’n broken my
spectacles and aw’ve never yet been able to
get a pair that suited me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The “Peterloo Massacre” was a baptism of
blood for the cause of reform, and the Tory
victory was worse than a defeat, for it excited the
indignation of all England against those who had
caused the slaughter of their fellow-subjects for
demanding admission within the pale of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rev. W. R. Hay wrote to Lord Sidmouth
on the night of Peterloo giving his version of the
affair. At the same time Mr. J. E. Taylor and
Mr. Archibald Prentice each sent a plain account
of the disgraceful conduct of the magistrates and
the yeomanry. These appeared in London
papers, and the accuracy of their narratives was
amply confirmed by Mr. John Tyas, the representative
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>of the <cite>Times</cite>, whom blundering “Jo”
Nadin had taken into custody as one of the
dreaded conspirators. The effect was to rouse a
storm of indignation before which even the obtuse
magistrates quailed. On the 19th, a hole-and-corner
meeting was held in their interests at the
Star Inn, when thanks were awarded to the
justices and the yeomanry. This was responded
to by a protest signed by 4,800 of the merchants,
manufacturers, and others of the “respectable
classes,” in which the meeting just mentioned
was described as a private one, and those who
had thus falsely claimed to speak for Manchester
were invited to call a public meeting. On the
27th, Lord Sidmouth conveyed the thanks of the
Prince Regent to the magistrates and military
“for their prompt, decisive, and efficient measures
for the preservation of the public peace.” Mr.
Hay and his friends had need of sympathy, for
they were the objects of general execration.
Meetings all over the kingdom were held, at
which their sanguinary interference with the right
of public meeting was denounced. The sympathy
felt with the working men reformers was not
confined to one class. The Duke of Hamilton
subscribed to the fund for the relief of the
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>sufferers. Earl Fitzwilliam was dismissed from
his post of Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding
for his energetic protest against Peterloo. Sir
Francis Burdett made a still more vigorous
protest, and his letter to the electors of Westminster
led to his imprisonment for three months,
and the infliction of a fine of £2,000. Shelley,
writing to Peacock, exclaims, “What an infernal
business this is of Manchester! What is to be
done?” What he did was to write his “Mask of
Anarchy,” in which he made a call to the
nation:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Rise like lions after slumber,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In unvanquishable number;</div>
      <div class='line'>Shake your chains to earth like dew,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which in sleep had fallen on you;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ye are many—they are few.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The effect of Peterloo was to bring forth a
greater disposition to united action between the
middle and the working classes on the reform
question. The authorities on their side strained
the law to crush out the reformers. An inquest
was opened as to the death of John Lees, who
died from the wounds he had received on the
field. The object of the coroner was to avoid an
unfavourable verdict, and this he accomplished
first by not putting in an appearance at all, and
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>then by frequent adjournments, so that the
inquest, which opened 8th September, continued
until December, and was never concluded.
When Parliament met in November, Earl Grey
moved an amendment to the Address in which
the Manchester massacre was denounced as
illegal and unconstitutional, but this was defeated
by a large majority, as was a similar motion in
the House of Commons. Sidmouth carried the
series of coercive measures known as the “Six
Acts,” and the powers of reaction were in full
triumph. Several efforts were made, but in
vain, to bring the assailants of the meeting to
justice, and even as late as 1822 an unsuccessful
action was brought against Captain Birley and
three others of the yeomanry by one whom they
had cut down.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whilst the reformers were thus baffled in their
endeavours to obtain justice, the partisan magistrates
and judges made short work of those who
fell into their power. Hunt and others who were
arrested at Peterloo were sent to Lancaster, and
the trial was removed to York. It was so plain
that the Peterloo meeting was not illegal in itself,
that every effort was made to connect it with
previous drillings on White Moss, where a spy
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>named Murray had been beaten by some of the
reformers assembled there. The banners, one of
which had on it the words, “Equal Representation
or Death,” and others inscribed “No Corn
Laws,” “No Boroughmongers,” were also made
the most of. Five of the accused were acquitted,
but Hunt, Johnson, Knight, Healey, and
Bamford were found guilty of seditious conspiracy.
Hunt received sentence of two years’
imprisonment, whilst Bamford and the others
were condemned to a year’s imprisonment.
Johnson was refused permission to visit, even
in the custody of an officer, the deathbed of
his wife. The Government had soon an
opportunity of rewarding the Rev. Mr. Hay, and
his appointment soon after Peterloo to the rich
living of Rochdale increased the popular hatred
which pursued him to the grave. An epigram
of the time reads:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hay making at Christmas, 15th January, 1820.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Well may the men of Rochdale say</div>
      <div class='line in4'>That certain trades alone are thriving;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who pay so high a price for <em>Hay</em>?</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Whose <em>butcher</em> gets so good a living!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>There was no perceptible change in the
position of the reform question for some years.
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>The House of Commons was in the hands of
the boroughmongers, and the traffic in seats
was notorious. Whilst Manchester was unrepresented,
there were 200 members returned by 100
boroughs, whose united population was less than
that of Manchester alone. In 1827, Manchester
was fluttered by the prospect of a seat in
Parliament being assigned to it. Penrhyn was
then in bad odour for its corruption, and Lord
John Russell gave notice that if it were disfranchised
he would move that its power of
electing two members should be transferred to
Manchester. A meeting convened by persons of
all parties was held in the still unplastered room
of what is now the Old Town Hall. Tories like
Mr. H. H. Birley and Mr. Benjamin Braidley
were joined with Radicals and Whigs like Mr.
Thomas Potter, Mr. G. W. Wood, Mr. John
Shuttleworth, and Mr. F. R. Atkinson to petition
for representation. This was all the more
necessary since a member of the House of
Commons, Mr. Legh Keck, strenuously denied
that the great towns desired to have representatives
in Parliament. The history of the bill
was curious. It passed the Commons, and the
second reading in the Lords was fixed for 23rd
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>June. Lord Lyndhurst held that as there were
420 voters and only fourteen were shown to have
been bribed, the further progress of the measure
should be resisted. Lord de Dunstanville, who
had property in the neighbourhood, naturally
concurred. Lord Eldon had not known “a case
so utterly destitute of foundation.” Lord Dacre
declared that as the object of the bill was to
transfer the franchise from the landed to the
commercial interest he should oppose it. The
then Marquis of Salisbury called attention to
the preamble of the bill, which ran—“Whereas,
on account of the great wealth and population
of Manchester, it is expedient that it should
return burgesses to Parliament.” “Now,” said
the noble Lord, “in that single sentence were
embodied all the wildest doctrines of reform.
If there were no other ground for opposition
he should oppose this bill on that ground alone.
As no other noble lord had objected to the bill
on that ground he had determined to enter his
protest against such doctrines being smuggled
into a bill to ruin the constitution.” In face of
this Tory opposition the bill was withdrawn. A
town’s meeting was held at Manchester in
February, 1830, when Mr. John Brooks exhibited
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>a list of bad debts for the year 1829,
amounting to £11,180, and of bad debts in
January-February, 1830, to the extent of £981.
Mr. Prentice, Mr. Elijah Dixon, and others
who spoke referred to the constitution of Parliament
as the cause why no attempt was made
to remedy the existing distress. In Parliament
Lord John Russell vainly endeavoured to obtain
hearing for a proposal to give Birmingham,
Manchester, and Leeds representatives; O’Connell
tried to bring in a bill for universal suffrage,
triennial parliaments, and the ballot. Lord
John Russell moved two resolutions in favour
of an increased number of representatives, and
for the additional ones being given to the
large towns and populous counties. Both
proposals were rejected by large majorities.</p>

<p class='c004'>The death of George IV. on the 26th June,
1830, may be taken as the landmark between
the old and the new era. The French revolution
of July gave an impetus to the desire for reform
at home. The Boroughreeve of Manchester
declined to call a meeting of the inhabitants to
congratulate the French people on the reconquest
of their liberty, but the meeting was held in spite
of official opposition, and Mr. Mark Philips,
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>Mr. Alexander Kay, and Mr. J. C Dyer were
appointed a deputation to convey the address
then adopted to Paris. The need for reform
at home was insisted upon by Mr. Richard Potter,
Mr. R. H. Greg, Mr. G. Hadfield, and other
speakers. The reformers were staggered when
Parliament met in November by the language
of the Duke of Wellington, who said that “he
had never heard or read of any measure up to the
present moment which could in any degree satisfy
his mind that the state of the representation could
be improved or be rendered more satisfactory
to the country at large than at the present time.
He was fully convinced that the country possessed
at the present moment a Legislature which
answered all the good purposes of legislation, and
this to a greater degree than any Legislature ever
answered in any country whatever.... He
was not only not prepared, but he would at
once declare that, so far as he was concerned,
as long as he held any station in the Government
of the country, he should always feel it to be
his duty to resist such measures when proposed
by others.” The Duke next advised the King
that it would be unsafe to trust himself in the city.
On the 15th, the Duke was defeated and resigned,
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>and Earl Grey took his place pledged to peace,
retrenchment, and reform.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Manchester the year was remarkable for the
opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railway,
and the formation of a Political Union very much
on the plan of that of Birmingham. This association
was at first mainly composed of shopkeepers
and working men, but was afterwards joined by
representatives of all classes. Amongst the
artisan members was Mr. Rowland Detrosier, a
self-taught workman, remarkable for the extent of
his intellectual acquirements and for his great
oratorical powers. An early death cut short a
career that promised the highest distinction. In
January, 1831, a requisition was presented to the
Boroughreeve and constables asking them to call
a meeting to petition for reform. They declined
because the town was in an excited state. A
great meeting was, however, held on the 20th,
and the petition adopted. On the 31st a petition
for representation was adopted at a town’s meeting
in Salford. When Lord John introduced the bill
on the 1st of March he put the case of the great
towns very neatly. “Our opponents say our
ancestors gave Old Sarum representatives, therefore
we should give Old Sarum representatives.
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>We say our ancestors gave Old Sarum representatives
because it was a large town; therefore we
give representatives to Manchester, which is a
large town.” Henry Hunt, who spoke on the
second day of the debate, vindicated the reform
agitation in which he had taken part, and, in spite
of attempts to drown his voice, denounced “the
drunken and infuriated yeomanry” who had
slaughtered the people in 1819 for doing that
which the Government was then doing—advocating
the propriety of Parliamentary reform. A
town’s meeting was held in Manchester on the
8th March to thank the Ministry for the introduction
of the bill. This was the first gathering of
the kind that had ever been convened by the
authorities. In the House of Commons the
second reading was carried by a majority of
one. In the Committee stage there was a
long fight, and on their proposal to reduce the
number of members, the Government were
put in a minority of eight. The King, although
regarded by the public as a reformer, was really
in great dread of the bill, and had refused to
dissolve until stung by some language used in
the Lords. “What did they dare to meddle with
the prerogative?” he exclaimed, and then declared
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>that he would go down to dissolve the
House in a hackney coach if necessary. He
went down. “Turn the rogues out, your
Majesty,” was the advice of a rough sailor who
rushed from the crowd to the side of the carriage.
He gave voice to the feeling of the nation. Parliament
was dissolved, and the Tories strained
every nerve to secure a victory at the polls.
The Duke of Northumberland alone is said to
have subscribed £100,000 to their election fund.
But the nation at large saw that the choice lay
between reform and revolution, and a great
majority of the counties and free boroughs returned
candidates who were pledged to support the bill.
The bill was re-introduced, and passed the second
reading on July 7th by a majority of 136. Next
day “Orator” Hunt presented a petition from
194,000 working people of Manchester and the
district in favour of universal suffrage, annual
parliaments, and vote by ballot. When the
question of enfranchisement came up, some members
argued that as Manchester was to have two
members, there was no need to give one to
Salford. The bill was introduced on the 25th of
June, but the tactics of delay were so well
observed that the third reading was not reached
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>until September 22nd. That very day there was
a town’s meeting in Manchester, when Mr. James
Burt, the Boroughreeve, again presided. The
speakers included Mr. Richard Potter, Mr. Mark
Philips, Mr. R. H. Greg, Mr. G. Hadfield, and
others. The only dissentient was a working man,
who was, however, ready to accept the bill as a
stepping-stone to something better. A similar
meeting was held in Salford in the following week.
The bill was brought into the House of Lords
on the 3rd of October, and its rejection was
moved by the Earl of Wharncliffe. The debate
was continued until the 8th, when the votes for
the bill were 158, against 199. The majority of
41 included a contingent of 21 Tory bishops, on
whose behalf the then Archbishop of Canterbury
made the hypocritical declaration “that to a
temperate and safe reform he would offer no
objections.” The prelates have since learned
more sense.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the 12th October there was an immense
gathering in Manchester. The first intention
was to hold a meeting in the then Riding School
in Lower Mosley Street, which would hold about
4,000 persons. The street was, however, so full
of eager candidates for admission that it was
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>decided to hold the meeting in the open-air at
Campfield. The Boroughreeve, not feeling equal
to the control of such a gathering, Mr. (afterwards
Sir) Thomas Potter presided over this
meeting of one hundred thousand persons. The
temper of the people was bitterly hostile to the
Lords. When Mr. Shuttleworth spoke of the
necessity of creating fresh peers, the response
was, “No more peers; we’ve had enough of
them.” One of the Radicals, Mr. R. J. Richardson,
moved an amendment asking the King to
issue writs to populous boroughs, to withhold them
from rotten boroughs, to create no new peers, but
to take such other measures as would ensure a
bill for universal suffrage, annual parliaments,
and vote by ballot. This was carried by an
enormous majority, and the vast assembly then
peaceably dispersed. At Bristol and other places
there were disastrous riots. In Manchester the
influence of the Political Union and the good
sense of the people generally, who were willing to
accept the bill as a substantial instalment of
reform, prevented any outbreak. Parliament was
prorogued until December 6th. The second bill
was introduced on the 12th, and the second reading
was carried in the early hours of Sunday morning,
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>December 18th, by a majority of 162 in a House
of 486. The third reading was not reached until
March 19th, when 355 voted for and 239 against.
The great question now was, “What will the
Lords do?” It soon became apparent that they
would mutilate the bill. On a motion by Lord
Lyndhurst, the Ministry found themselves in a
minority of 35. The King’s fears had been
increased by the riots, and he refused Earl Grey
the power to create such fresh peers as would
give him a majority. The Ministry resigned, and
the Duke of Wellington, as the leader of the
Tories, was “sent for” on the 9th of May. The
news reached Manchester by seven o’clock on the
following morning, and the excitement was intense.
Business was suspended, and groups of citizens
were seen discussing the gravity of the situation.
The Reform Committee had sat daily at the Town
Hall since the previous September, and thither
flocked the friends of reform. On the motion of
Mr. Absolom Watkin, a petition to the Commons
was adopted, calling upon them to refuse to vote
any supplies until the bill was passed. The
petition was not placed for signature until nearly
three o’clock, but by six it had received 24,000
signatures, and Mr. Richard Potter, Mr. John
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>Fielden, and Mr. John Shuttleworth set off in a
chaise to take it to London. They departed
amidst the cheers of the multitude, and had an
enthusiastic greeting at Leek, Derby, Northampton,
and other places on the road. The
journey was accomplished in seventeen hours. As
they approached London they gave reports of the
meeting and copies of the petition to the passengers
of the coaches on the road, and the news
spread like wildfire through the country. The
petition was presented to the House that same
night by Mr. John Wood, <span class='fss'>M.P.</span> for Preston.
This was the first call to the Commons to stop
supplies until reform was obtained, and it had
quickly many echoes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Peterloo was the place selected for an open-air
meeting on the 14th. Mr. C. J. S. Walker, the
son of the man whose house had been attacked by
the Tories of 1792, was called to the chair, and
the venerable Robert Philips, a veteran of ’92,
moved the first resolution. Mr. Elijah Dixon
and Mr. Joseph Johnson, who had been imprisoned
after Peterloo, were amongst the
speakers. A town’s meeting was held in Salford,
and another in Chorlton. Throughout the
country the same sentiment prevailed, and it was
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>said that the Duke of Wellington would try to
form a Ministry that should deal with reform.
The announcement was received with such a
storm of indignation that even the victor of
Waterloo was cowed. The King had to recall
Earl Grey, but to avoid the creation of fresh
peers a sufficient number of the Lords abstained
from the divisions, and the Reform Bill became
law on the 7th of June, 1832. The general joy
found expression in a grand procession of the
authorities and trade societies of Manchester and
Salford on the 9th of August. In the long
debates on the Reform Bill nothing is more
remarkable than the distrust of the people felt by
the opponents of reform. There was a prophetic
instinct in Earl Grey’s reply to a sneer of
the Earl of Dudley. “The Earl of Dudley,”
said Earl Grey, “will live to learn a lesson from
the statesmen of Birmingham and the philanthropists
of Manchester.”</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>The Folk-Lore of Lancashire.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>Folk-lore is a word introduced into the
English language by the late Mr. W. J.
Thorns to designate the superstitions, observances,
sayings, traditions, and beliefs of the people; the
collecting and systematic arrangement of which
is now recognised as an important section of the
science of comparative mythology. Folk-lore
treats</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“Of witching rhymes</div>
      <div class='line'>And evil spirits; of the death-bed call</div>
      <div class='line'>Of him who robb’d the widow, and devour’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The orphan’s portion; of unquiet souls</div>
      <div class='line'>Risen from the grave to ease the heavy guilt</div>
      <div class='line'>Of deeds in life concealed; of shapes that walk</div>
      <div class='line'>At dead of night, and clank their chains and wave</div>
      <div class='line'>The torch of Hell around the murderer’s bed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It takes cognisance of all the quaint notions
connected with the varying seasons of the year
and epochs of human life; of all the beliefs in
futurity and supernatural agencies which are not
sanctioned by religion; of the fireside story; of
the milk-maid’s song and the mother’s lullaby; in
short, of all the remains of ancient religion, history,
science, and philosophy which have been preserved
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>to the present day in the conservative
memory and affection of the people. The old
songs of the peasantry, the grandam’s fairy tales,
the children’s rhymes, the auguries and omens of
the ignorant and least educated portion of the
community might seem at first sight to be
unworthy of the serious attention of the antiquary.
But experience has shown that these humble
materials afford really important data for the
student of mythology and anthropology. Customs,
which once formed part of the ceremonial of
creeds outworn, survive amongst European nations,
as an evidence of their pre-Christian belief. The
characters of the nursery tales are credited with
the performance of deeds once attributed to
mighty gods or heroes. The collation of these
narratives enables us to remove some myths from
the historic page. In a similar manner the
examination of popular superstitions throws light
upon the various systems of mythology. There
is a great similarity noticeable in the folk-lore of
different nations, even those which are most
remote. Thus the legend narrated by Herodotus
of Rhampsinitus is found to have been popular
with the Norse children; and while this is the
case with stories which do not appear to have
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>any allegorical meaning, it is still more so with
regard to those conceptions which we term myths.
Each historic nation has emerged from a savage
condition, more or less profound, and its folk-lore
is merely fragmentary recollections of its past
stages, often in the form of ceremonials dictated
by principles no longer forming the ordinary rule
of action, or even directly opposed to it. And as
the ideas of savages are limited in number, and
derived mainly from the contemplation of natural
phenomena likely to strike each observer in the
same manner, it ceases to be so great a matter of
wonder that widely separated races of mankind
should invent similar explanations to account for
the wild or wonderful appearances which excited
their awe and astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>The literature of folk-lore has grown with
great rapidity, and the foundation of the
Folk-Lore Society greatly stimulated the study
in this country. Mr. G. L. Gomme has defined
folk-lore to be the science which treats of
the survivals of archaic belief and custom in
modern ages. His suggested classification
shows the wide scope of the new science.
The first branch, <i>Traditional Narratives</i>, includes
folk-tales, hero-tales, ballads and songs, and place-legends.
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>Under <i>Traditional Customs</i> he includes
local customs, festivals, customs, ceremonial
customs, and games. The third division, <i>Superstitions
and Beliefs</i>, includes witchcraft, astrology,
and superstitious practices and fancies. The last
department, <i>Folk-speech</i>, covers popular sayings,
popular nomenclature, proverbs, jingle-rhymes,
riddles, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>The literature of the folk-lore of Lancashire is
somewhat extensive, for references to popular
superstitions and customs abound in the writings
of Edwin Waugh, Ben Brierley, and the many
writers who have illustrated the dialect of the
county, and especially of its south-western portion.
The late Mr. John Roby, whose “Traditions of
Lancashire” first appeared in 1829, was a diligent
collector of local legends, but his object was purely
literary, and accordingly his book must be used
cautiously, though it certainly contains important
data. The “Lancashire Dialect Glossary” of
Messrs. Nodal and Milner contains many references
to popular customs. There are also
many articles in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> the
<cite>Palatine Note-Book</cite>, <cite>Local Gleanings</cite>, <cite>Manchester
City News Notes and Queries</cite>, <cite>Manchester
Guardian Notes and Queries</cite>, and other
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>literary and archæological periodicals. The
principal authorities on the subject are Messrs.
John Harland and T. T. Wilkinson, whose
“Lancashire Folk-lore” appeared in 1867, followed
by “Lancashire Legends” in 1873. These have
been several times reprinted. Mr. Charles Hardwick,
in 1872, published a volume, the wide sweep
of which is shown by the title, “Traditions,
Superstitions, and Folk-lore, chiefly Lancashire
and the North of England, their affinity to others
in widely distributed localities, and their Eastern
origin and mythical significance.” Then Mr.
James Bowker has written “The Goblin Stories
of Lancashire.” Harland’s “Lancashire Ballads”
should also be consulted, nor must the publications
of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire
and of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian
Society be neglected.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some may be inclined to ask, “Is there any
folk-lore left?” Certainly during the present age
the rapid diffusion of knowledge has happily
driven forth much antique superstition; but there
is a temptation to exaggerate the extent of
the effects which have thus been produced. In
Lancashire, where we might have expected
to find that the noise of the steam-engine had
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>frightened away both the fairies and the queen
of the May, and the spread of knowledge to
have destroyed all faith in spells and charms,
interesting articles of folk-lore have been recorded
as either still surviving, or as having
only recently become obsolete. Many observances
are connected with particular seasons
of the year. Thus on New Year’s Day there
is a firm belief that if a light-haired person “let in”
the New Year, a twelve month of ill-luck will
be the result, and that, on the contrary, dark
persons will bring with them a year of good
fortune. So Pan-cake Tuesday, Simnel Sunday,
Easter, May Day, Christmas, etc., have each their
special customs still observed in Lancashire,
though in many cases so shorn of their ancient
glories as to be little more than relics of former
greatness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The habit of attaching a symbolic importance,
even to the most trifling occurrences, is strikingly
illustrated in the following quotations from
Harland and Wilkinson:—“Most grandmothers
will explain, ‘God bless you!’ when they hear
a child sneeze, and they sum up the philosophy of
the subject with the following lines, which used to
delight the writer in the days of his childhood:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>‘Sneeze on a Monday, you sneeze for danger;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sneeze on a Tuesday, you kiss a stranger;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sneeze on a Wednesday, you sneeze for a letter;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sneeze on a Thursday, for something better;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sneeze on a Friday, you sneeze for sorrow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sneeze on a Saturday, your sweetheart to-morrow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sneeze on a Sunday, your safety seek,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Devil will have you the whole of the week.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is certainly a comprehensive epitome of
the entire philosophy of sneezing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The finger-nails of a baby should be bitten
shorter. If they are cut, the child will become
“sharp fingered”—<i>i.e.</i>, thievish.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a specimen of the folk-tale, we may take
that of the “Three Tasks.” The inhabitants
of Cockerham, having made up their minds
that the devil had been showing an unreasonable
partiality to their village, gave the schoolmaster
the not very pleasant task of expelling the Prince
of Darkness from their midst. The man of
letters, having raised the foul fiend, appointed
him three tasks; if he failed to accomplish them
he was never to appear again at Cockerham,
but if he succeeded in their performance, the
pedagogue became his prey. The two first tasks
were soon done, but the third, the fatal, mystic
third—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>“Now make me, dear sir, a rope of yon sand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which will bear washing in Cocker, and not lose a strand”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>proved too much even for the ingenuity of the
Father of Evil, and if he stuck to his bargain
Cockerham must be the happiest place on earth!
This legend of the Three Tasks is not confined
to Lancashire, but is also narrated in connection
with Merton Sands, Cheshire, and a Cornish
version forms the subject of “Featherstone’s
Doom,” one of the Rev. R. S. Hawker’s
wildest lyrics. Another curious story is that
which says that the parochial church of Burnley
was originally intended to be built on the
site occupied by the old Saxon Cross in Godly
Lane; “but however much the masons might
have built during the day, both stones and
scaffolding were invariably found where the
church now stands on their coming to work next
morning.” This legend is told also of Rochdale,
Winwick, Samlesbury, Over, Saddleworth, Churchdown,
and many other churches.</p>

<p class='c004'>A winding-sheet in the candle, spilling the salt,
crossing knives, and various other trifles, are
omens of evil to thousands even at this day.
Should one of your children fall sick when on a
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>visit to a friend’s house, it is held to be sure to
entail bad luck on that family for the rest of the
year, if you stay over New Year’s Day. Persons
have been known to travel sixty miles with a
sick child, rather than run the risk. A flake of
soot on the bars of the grate is said to indicate
the approach of a stranger; a bright spark on the
wick of a candle, or a long piece of stalk in the
tea-cup, betokens a similar event. When the fire
burns briskly some lover smirks or is good-humoured.
A cinder thrown out of the fire by a
jet of gas from burning coals is looked upon as a
coffin if its hollow be long; as a purse of gold if
the cavity be round. Crickets in houses are
said to indicate good fortune, but should they
forsake the chimney corner, it is a sure sign of
coming misfortune.</p>

<p class='c004'>By this time the mixture of races in Lancashire
is so complete that it is not easy to gather at first
hand fresh data as to indigenous superstitions.
This is more especially the case in the populous
districts, where immigrants from every part of the
United Kingdom and from abroad have been
attracted by the great industries of the County
Palatine. These influxes have necessarily had
their influence upon the population and its beliefs.
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>There is the danger of mistaking for a genuine
product of the Lancashire soil what is merely an
exotic. This danger exists as to oral tradition,
but is still greater with regard to what has become
literature. It will be well to illustrate this by a
concrete example. In the pleasant volume of
“Poems and Songs” by Thomas Newbigging there
is a poem entitled “The Story of Old Gamul,”
narrating as a Rossendale tradition one of those
strange legends which are links in the history of
fiction. According to Mr. Newbigging’s story,
old Gamul had the enmity of but one man—the
keeper, who determined to work his destruction.
This villain caused a pit to be dug, and cunningly
covered over with turf and branches. Thinking
that the victim is already there, the keeper
goes to the place and falls into it himself.
Gamul soon after passes, and hearing a cry
for help, lets down ropes, and pulls up, first
a lion, then a serpent, then an ape, and last
of all his enemy. The keeper invites Gamul
to his house, and when he goes there, knocks
him down with a club, and casts him forth
as dead. Gamul, however, recovers, and when
next he goes to the wood, he is aided in his
labour by the ape, the serpent brings him
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>“the adder’s magic stone,” and the lion shows
him a cave full of treasure.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That lucky night went Gamul home,</div>
      <div class='line'>The richest wight in Christendom.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The keeper finally hangs himself for vexation,
and the old woodman becomes Sir Gamul.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nor e’er were turned the homeless poor</div>
      <div class='line'>Unfriended from the open door.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A work by a German named Massenius was
published at Cologne in 1657. It was entitled
“Palæstra Dramatica,” and contained, amongst
other curious narratives, one of a certain Signor
Vitalis, who fell into a pit in which a lion, a
monkey, and a serpent had also fallen. They
were all rescued by an honest countryman,
Massaccio, to whom Vitalis promised a marriage-dower
and his palace. Once safe, he denies all
knowledge of his deliverer. The beasts prove
more grateful, but a gem which is given to the
peasant by the serpent leads to a suspicion that he
has stolen it. At the trial Vitalis again denies
him, but is overwhelmed with confusion when the
beasts enter the court and force from him an involuntary
confession. A translation of this story
appeared in <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> for March,
1835. The fable was, however, not invented
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>by Massenius, for in a slightly different form it
occurs in the “Gesta Romanorum,” that famous
collection of mediæval stories. It also attracted
the notice of Gower, and is told in the “Confessio
Amantis,” in this the lion is omitted. Matthew
Paris gives it as an apologue told by Richard of
the Lion Heart. Finally it is found in that storehouse
of Eastern legend, the <i>Calilah u Dimnah</i>.
This was translated by Doni into Italian, and
an English rendering of his version appeared
in 1570. Massenius may have obtained the
story either from the “Gesta,” or from this book
of Doni. It is very probable that many other
versions exist. But does Mr. Newbigging’s
poem really represent a Lancashire tradition?
To solve this doubt the readiest way was to
put the question to him. The following is his
reply:—“With some differences my ‘reverend
Grannie’ used to relate this story to amuse my
childhood. I cannot help smiling when I look
back and remember the time when, if some
casualty, such as an unusually wet night, or a
‘hawket heel,’ or any of the thousand and one
ills attendant on boyhood, kept me chained to the
fireside, my invariable petition was, ‘Grannie!
gie’s auld Guy!’ (she gave the hero’s name as
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>Guy, not Gamul, as I have given it) and
forthwith ‘Auld Guy’ was related for the fiftieth
time by the same patient lips, and to the same
eager listener. I had never been able, though
I had looked long and carefully, to find anything
like it in print. My good grandam (who was
a rare old Scotch woman, full of old-world lore)
heard the story from her father, and she believed
that he had read it in some old book.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Doubtless this ancestor of Mr. Newbigging’s
read the story in one of the many editions
of the “Gesta Romanorum,” which was for
centuries a favourite story-book. The name
of Guido clearly indicates the source. It is a
striking instance of the passage of literature
into legend. In fifty years from now Mr. Newbigging’s
poem would be considered no light
proof of the existence of a Lancashire variant of
the story; yet, as we have just learned, it has no
connection with Rossendale, but came from Scotland,
and even then was a book tale, and not a
genuine legend. This instance will not have
been cited in vain if it warns any too enthusiastic
student “folk-lorist” of the pitfalls that beset his
path.</p>

<p class='c004'>We can only indicate the varied interest of
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>Lancashire folk-lore by two or three examples.
Let us take a phrase which may still be heard
occasionally, “Aw’m coming too, like th’ Clegg
Ho’ Boggart.” This is an allusion to a story told
of more than one old house in the county. The
inmates are perplexed and worried by the exploits
of a tricksy spirit that upsets the furniture, makes
strange noises, and generally renders everyone uncomfortable.
They decide to remove, but when
the furniture is on the cart, the “boggart” is heard
to exclaim, “I’m going too,” whereupon they decide
to remain and endure as best they may the unwelcome
companionship of their household spirit.
Now this story of the “flitting boggart” is a widespread
one. When Professor Worsaae was in
England, he surprised a Lancashire friend by
narrating a Scandinavian legend which is practically
identical. “<i>See i dag flitter vi</i>,” were the
words of the Danish brownie. The version given
by Mr. Roby appears to be merely a literary
appropriation of a Yorkshire story, but the
widespread character of the tale is undoubted.
Tennyson is familiar with it, and has thus put it
into verse:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... his house, for so they say,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was haunted with a jolly ghost, that shook</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>The curtains, whined in lobbies, tapt at doors,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rummaged like a rat: no servant stay’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>The farmer vext packs up his beds and chairs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his household stuff; and with his boy</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt his knees, his wife upon the tilt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sets out, and meets a friend who hails him, ‘What!</div>
      <div class='line'>You’re flitting!’ ‘Yes, we’re flitting,’ says the ghost</div>
      <div class='line'>(For they had pack’d the thing among the beds).</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh well,’ says he, ‘you flitting with us too,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Jack, turn the horses’ heads, and home again.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The late Mr. Charles Hardwick thought that
the flitting boggart was of Scandinavian origin,
and the evidence seemed strong enough, but
there is evidence that he is known in Italy. In
that charming book by Janet Ross, “The Land of
Manfred,” there is this interesting bit of folk-lore:—“I
observed that some of the flock the old
shepherd was guarding looked tired and hung
their heads wearily. I asked whether they were
ill, and he answered, ‘No; but I must get rid of
them, because the Laùro has taken an antipathy
to them.’ On further inquiry, he told me that
the Laùro was a little man, only thirty centimetres
high, always dressed in velvet, and wearing
a Calabrese hat with a feather stuck into it.
The Laùro is most capricious: to some who
ask him for money he gives a sackful of broken
potsherds; to others who ask for sand he gives old
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>coins. He took a particular dislike to a cousin of
the old shepherd’s, sitting on her chest at night
and giving her terrible dreams. At last she
was so worried by the Laùro that she determined
to leave her house. All the household goods and
chattels were on the cart; nothing was left but
an old broom, and when the goodwife went
to fetch it the Laùro suddenly appeared, saying,
‘I’ll take that; let us be off to the new house.’
His antipathies or likings are unaccountable;
he will steal the corn from one horse or mule
to give it to another, twist up their manes and
tails in a fantastic way, or shave them in queer
patterns. The Laùro would not allow the sheep
I had asked about to rest at night, and any animal
he hated had to be sold.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It may, of course, be said that the flitting
boggart went to Taranto with Guiscard’s
Normans in the eleventh century, but it is equally
probable that the Lancashire weaver and the
Italian peasant have each inherited their belief
from a common and an earlier source.</p>

<p class='c004'>The devil occupies a conspicuous place in
folk-lore, but he is not the fallen angel, dark,
gloomy, and majestic whom Milton drew, nor is
he the accomplished Mephistophiles, the spirit
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>that denies, whom Goethe has painted. The
devil of folk-lore is malignant but stupid, and
oftener the dupe of humanity than the slayer of
souls. This is evident in the story of the devil’s
task of making a rope of sand already named,
and is equally clear in the story of the tailor who
made a wager with the devil that he would beat
him at a sewing match. He succeeded by
giving the Evil One a needle with a thread in
it so long that for every stitch the demon had to
fly all round the room, whilst the tailor’s was only
of the normal length. The devil of folk-lore is
more like Pan and the satyrs, than he is like the
Adversary who tempted Job. But <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de mortuis nil
nisi honum</span></i>, and <em>if</em>—there is much virtue in an
<em>if</em>—if the devil is drowned let him rest in peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Archbishop Whately was a Fellow of
Oriel, he told this story in the Common Room:—“A
cobbler in Somersetshire dreamt that a
person told him that if he would go to London
Bridge he would meet with something to his
advantage. He dreamt the same the next night,
and again the night after. He then determined
to go to London Bridge, and walked thither
accordingly. When arrived there, he walked
about the whole of the first day without anything
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>occurring; the next day was passed in a similar
manner. He resumed his place the third day,
and walked about till evening, when, giving it
up as hopeless, he determined to leave London
and return home. At this moment a stranger
came up and said to him, ‘I have seen you for
the last three days walking up and down this
bridge; may I ask if you are waiting for
anyone?’ The answer was ‘No!’ ‘Then what is
your object in staying here?’ The cobbler then
frankly told his reason for being there, and the
dream that had visited him three successive
nights. The stranger then advised him to go
home again to his work, and no more pay any
attention to dreams. ‘I myself,’ he said, ‘had
about six months ago a dream. I dreamed
three nights together that, if I would go into
Somersetshire, in an orchard, under an apple-tree,
I should find a pot of gold; but I paid no
attention to my dream, and have remained quietly
at my business.’ It immediately occurred to the
cobbler that the stranger described his own
orchard and his own apple-tree. He immediately
returned home, dug under the apple-tree, and
found a pot of gold. After this increase of
fortune he was enabled to send his son to
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>school, where the boy learnt Latin. When he
came home for the holidays, he one day examined
the pot which had contained the gold, on which
was some writing. He said, ‘Father, I can show
you that what I have learnt at school is of some
use.’ He then translated the Latin inscription
on the pot thus, ‘Look under, and you will
find better.’ They did look under, and a
larger quantity of gold was found.” This story
was as current in Lancashire as in Somersetshire.
At Swaffham, in Norfolk, there is a figure of
a chapman and his dog. This pedlar popular
tradition describes as founding the church out
of a treasure found in the manner already
described. The story is current also in Cornwall
and in Yorkshire. It is narrated as a matter
of fact in the history of “Dost in Holland.” But
it is found in the Eastern as well as in the Western
world. This will be seen from this story which is
given in E. W. Lane’s “Arabian Tales and
Anecdotes”:—“It is related that a man of
Baghdád was possessed of ample riches and
great wealth; but his wealth passed away and his
state changed, and he became utterly destitute,
and could not obtain his sustenance save by
laborious exertion. And he slept one night,
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>overwhelmed and oppressed, and saw in his sleep
a person who said to him, ‘Verily thy fortune
is in Cairo; therefore seek it and repair to it.’
So he journeyed to Cairo; and when he arrived
there, the evening overtook him, and he slept
in a mosque. Now there was, adjacent to the
mosque, a house; and as God (whose name be
exalted!) had decreed, a party of robbers
entered the mosque, and thence passed to that
house; and the people of the house, awaking
at the disturbance occasioned by the robbers,
raised cries; whereupon the Wálee<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> came to
their aid with his followers, and the robbers
fled. The Wálee then entered the mosque,
and found the man of Baghdád sleeping there:
so he laid hold upon him, and inflicted upon
him a painful beating with mikra’ahst (the thick
end of a palm stick used for beating),
until he was at the point of death, and
imprisoned him; and he remained three days
in the prison; after which, the Wálee caused
him to be brought, and said to him, ‘From
what country art thou?’ He answered, ‘From
Baghdád.’—‘And what affair,’ said the Wálee,
‘was the cause of thy coming to Cairo?’ He
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>answered, ‘I saw in my sleep a person who said
to me, ‘Verily thy fortune is in Cairo: therefore
repair to it.’ And when I came to Cairo, I
found the fortune of which he told me to be
those blows of the palm stick that I have received
from thee.’—And upon this the Wálee laughed so
that his grinders appeared, and said to him, ‘O
thou son of little sense, <em>I</em> saw three times in
my sleep a person who said to me, ‘Verily a
house in Baghdád, in such a district, and of such
a description, hath in its court a garden, at the
lower end of which is a fountain, wherein is
wealth of great amount: therefore repair to it
and take it. But I went not: and thou,
through the smallness of thy sense, hast
journeyed from city to city on account of a thing
thou hast seen in sleep, when it was only an effect
of confused dreams.’—Then he gave him some
money, and said to him, ‘Help thyself with this to
return to thy city.’ So he took it and returned to
Baghdád. Now the house which the Wálee had
described, in Baghdád, was the house of that
man; therefore when he arrived at his abode,
he dug beneath the fountain, and beheld abundant
wealth. Thus God enriched and sustained
him; and this was a wonderful coincidence.”
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>This story is found in the “Masnavi,” written by
Jaláuddin, who died about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1260.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not always easy or even possible to
trace the precise pedigree of a popular superstition
or custom, but many of them can be <a id='ident' name='ident'></a>identified
as fragments of bygone religious and mythological
systems. When an old faith is supplanted by
a new, the missionaries, as a matter of tact, will
leave untouched customs that are harmless, and
will turn to better uses those that can safely
be modified or appropriated. Thus much of
folk-lore is fossil theology, and much of it is fossil
science. The wonderful “cures,” and sometimes
disgusting remedies that linger in use among
the ignorant, were the recognised methods of
the healing art a few generations ago. Folk-lore,
in some respect, corresponds to that wonderful
faculty of “make-believe” possessed by all
children, and is an inheritance from the mental
childhood of the race. The physical evils,
the mental and moral discordances of life,
are to primitive man not the result of the
operation of natural law, but abnormal phenomena,
the result of external non-human agencies.
Disease is not regarded as the result of infractions
of hygienic rules, but as the possession of the
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>sufferer by evil spirits. When man looked
around for an explanation of the facts of nature,
he found it by peopling the world with unseen
beings, who guarded the trees and the wells;
who let loose the storm and chained up the winds;
who had the good and the evil gifts of human
nature; who helped and hindered; who cheated
and were cheated. These imaginary beings
are sometimes merely the distortion and personification
of words. It is not every great language
that has attained to the dignity of a neuter
gender, though our own possesses one. Personification
is a common enough rhetorical device.
It is possible, then, that if we could accurately
analyse the notions of a modern Lancashire mind,
we should find in addition to the deliberately-held
faith of conviction fragments of the mythologies
of Greece and Rome and Scandinavia and India.</p>

<p class='c004'>In regard to popular traditions and the
household stories, so dear to children, they
have come to us by many routes, but the line
has always been from East to West. The
Buddhist missionaries, going forth to preach the
faith of Gautama, made abundant use of fables and
apologues to enforce their lessons. The traders,
as their caravans passed from land to land,
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>beguiled the tedium of the journey with such
narratives. The mediæval preachers freely
employed them in their discourses to the
unlearned people. If such a phrase be permitted,
these tales formed the unwritten popular literature
of the Middle Ages. The stories passed from
mouth to mouth, and were gradually associated
with the place and people best known to the
narrator. In this way legends become localised.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tendency of modern thought is to simplification.
The African savage, bowing to his fetish,
has probably a more complex theory of life than
the Oxford professor, and the study of folk-lore
shows how penetrating was the influence of
custom and superstition upon the life of the
people. It followed man from the cradle to the
grave. There were ceremonies to be observed at
birth, at marriage, at death; at every stage of the
journey of life. It gave to clouds and birds
omens that decided human fate. It peopled the
meadows with fairies, and the mountains with
witches; and made the woods and waters alive
with spirits, sometimes friendly, but often malignant.
It lighted the Beltane fires at Midsummer
and the Yule-log at Christmas. The Calendar of
the Year and the Calendar of Man’s Life alike
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>registered its decrees. Whatever happened, good
or bad, was referred alike to the supernatural
powers, who for bane or blessing were continually
intervening in the most trivial details of every
home. Fairies were sometimes friends and sometimes
foes, but witches and warlocks were entirely
malicious. The dead rested not in their graves,
but returned to terrify the living. The old gods,
dethroned from their eminence, remained as
demons to exercise a real and usually an evil
power. Viewed in this light the decay of folk-lore
may be regarded as an advantage. We may
regret the nymphs and dryads, and even the
“lubber fiend,” but with them vanish the whole
tribe of “witches and warlocks and things that
cried ‘Boh’ in the night.” We will not desire
to revive or retain the popular superstitions and
customs of bygone days, but as they pass away
let us examine them with careful and patient
attention, and see what they have to tell us of the
past history of the race and the psychology of
primitive man. Studied in this spirit we may
sometimes learn as much from the observation of
a child’s game as from the speculations of a
philosopher.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>Manchester Grammar School Mill.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>In 1883 the Manchester School Mill was
acquired by the Lancashire and Yorkshire
Railway Company, in order to make a new road
from Long Millgate to Victoria Station. With
the destruction of the School Mill there passed
away a curious relic of ancient custom, and a link
that connected modern Manchester with the
quaint old town that stood by Irk and Irwell in
the fourteenth century. In the very home of
Free Trade there existed a monopoly at least
six centuries old. The School Mill claimed the
right to grind all the malt that is brewed within
the limits of the old town of Manchester. This
monopoly is but a fragment of its former
privileges, which were abolished as inimical to the
general good more than a century ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Roman times as a prime requisite a water mill,
it is said, was erected upon the rocky channel of
the Medlock below the station and town, on a
site which in later times was called Knot Mill.
If this be correct, the situation must have been
found inconvenient, for the town mill next heard
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>of was situated on the Irk. The right of compelling
their vassals to grind at the “lord’s mill,”
and to pay such tolls as he might fix, was a
valuable privilege to the lord of the manor of a
busy and thriving place. When Randle, Earl of
Chester, granted the first charter to Salford in
1230, he said in it:—“No burgess ought to bake
bread to be sold save at my oven by reasonable
custom. If I shall have a mill there the burgesses
shall grind at my mill to the twentieth measure,
and if I shall not have a mill there they may
grind where they will.” When Thomas Grelle,
Baron of Manchester, in 1301, granted the
charter, by which for many succeeding centuries
Manchester was governed, he was careful to
remind his burgesses that they should have their
corn ground at his mill and their bread baked
at his oven, “paying to the aforesaid mill and
aforesaid oven the customs as they ought and are
wont to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Grammar School was founded in 1515 by
Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter, Hugh Bexwyke,
Ralph Hulme, and Joan Bexwyke, and in what
respective proportion the institution is due to
these worthies may be a matter of doubt. For
the endowment of the school they purchased, for
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>a “valuable consideration,” the amount of which
is not stated, the lands, rents, and services of the
Manchester Corn Mills and all their tolls. Lord
La Warr, in thus parting with the ancient soke
mills of his manor, merely retained a chief rent,
which was then fixed at £9 13s. 4d. The
transfer of the mill from the wardens of the
college to an independent body of feoffees is set
forth in a deed which was executed in 1525,
and in which Hugh Bexwyke, clerk, and Joan
Bexwyke, widow, state that Thomas West, Knt.,
Lord La Warr, “did give grant and confirm to
them and to Ralph Hulme, deceased, all his lands
and tenements, rents, reversions, and services of
his water corn mills, called Manchester Mills,
situate and being in the town of Manchester,
upon the water or rivulet of Irke, running and
flowing from and in the town of Manchester and
the precincts of the same as far as the water or
river of Irwell, flowing between the town of
Manchester and the town of Salford, and also
of all the tolls soken of the aforesaid mills of
all the tenants of the said Lord La Warr in
Manchester, and of his sojourners of the same,
and of all other residents there.” Further, the
same Thomas, Lord La Warr did give, grant, and
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>confirm to them his “fulling mill there, called a
walke millne, situate, standing, and being upon
the said rivulet or water called Irke; and also his
close of land, with its appurtenances, called
Walker’s Croft; and also Thomas, Lord La Warr
in like manner did give, grant, and confirm to
them the aforesaid water or rivulet of Irke,
and its free fishery, from a place called Asshelle
Lawne as far as the said water or river called
Irwell, and also all his lands and tenements
adjacent and adjoining, without the several closes
and burgage on each side of the same water or
rivulet called Irke, flowing in the said town of
Manchester, from the place called Asshelle Lawne,
into the said river of Irwell.” And farther, the
same Thomas, Lord La Warr did give, grant, and
confirm to them “full power and authority, and
right of making, setting-up, fixing, and attaching
mills or messuages, and so many and such weirs,
floodgates, and fastenings, to both sides of the
same water or rivulet, called Irke, and upon,
through, and across the same water, in any places
whatsoever, from the said place, called Asshelle
Lawne, unto the said water or river of Irwell,” as
they or their heirs and assigns should think to be
expedient or beneficial for their greater profit or
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>advantage. Lord La Warr also conveyed to the
purchasers by the same deed some fulling mills in
Ancoats, where there are various evidences of the
early practice of textile industries. The value of
the Manchester Mills when they were first
bought as an endowment for the school was
estimated at £47 10s. per annum. Lord La
Warr promised that no more mills should be
erected within or about the manor of Manchester,
and thus ensured to the schools the monopoly of
the grinding of the corn and malt for the town.
The restraint was probably felt to be injurious at
a comparatively early period. In 1556 those who
evaded this toll were threatened with amercement,
and apparently continued to be undeterred by
such threats, for in 1561 it was ordered that “in
future” they should forfeit twenty shillings. In
1592 the feoffees had to guard their monopoly
against the attack of Anthony Travis, who erected
“a horse mill within the town.” The Duchy
Court of Lancaster upheld the rights of the
monopolists, and actually prohibited the use within
the town of even a hand mill or quern mill for
the grinding of either corn or malt. If, however,
the grain lay at the mill for twenty-four hours
unground the owner might take it away to some
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>other mill. In 1608 a horse mill was ordered to
be destroyed. During the Commonwealth the
people of the town had freedom in this matter,
and they used it so that the revenues of the school
began to diminish very rapidly. An order of
Parliament was obtained in 1647, and the mills
were then leased to Mr. John Hartley for £130
per annum. The new lessee established his
right against two hardy individuals who had set
up a common brewhouse in the college, which
they contended owed no suit or service to the
School Mills. The decision went against them.
In 1701 some persons who had erected mills in
Salford were prosecuted for having customers
who ought to have ground at the Manchester
Mills. They were ordered not to receive any
corn or malt for grinding from any of the inhabitants
of Manchester. In 1728 some persons
who had erected a brewhouse in Salford and sold
ale and beer to the burgesses of Manchester were
required “under pain of forfeiting £100 to have
all their corn and malt that should be spent ground
in their houses at the School Mills.” The farmers
of the mill at this time made an attempt to obtain
a judgment that should include oats, which had
not been ground at the School Mills for two
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>generations. The Judges, however, insisted that
an issue ought to be directed for trying the
custom at common law. This the farmers did
not think expedient, and so they dropped the
suit and paid the costs. In 1732 they were
successful in restraining Sir Oswald Mosley from
using a malt mill which he had erected in
Hanging Ditch. It will easily be understood
that the tenants of the mills were exceedingly
unpopular with the inhabitants. Witty John
Byrom, in an epigram which became proverbial,
thus lampooned the two of them, who from
their spare forms had been nicknamed Skin
and Bone:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bone and Skin, two millers thin,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would starve the town, or near it;</div>
      <div class='line'>But be it known to Skin and Bone</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That Flesh and Blood won’t bear it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>This was written in 1737, and there was something
prophetic in the quatrain, for in 1757, when
the pressure of hard times was severely felt, there
was a fatal riot arising out of the popular feeling
against the monopoly. On June 6th the provisions
brought by the farmers to the market were seized
by the mob, and a considerable quantity was
destroyed. The approach of harvest would, it
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>was hoped, bring something of peace and plenty,
but when this anticipation proved delusive, the
patience of the people was exhausted, and a
large assembly from Saddleworth, Oldham, and
other parts, having destroyed a corn mill at
Clayton, advanced to Shudehill. They were met,
however, by Mr. James Bayley, who was then
high sheriff of the county, and who had with
him a party of soldiers and a large number of the
well-to-do inhabitants on horseback. The rioters,
confident that the soldiers would not fire upon
them, proceeded to various acts of violence. The
goods in the market were seized, the troops were
pelted with stones, and one of the soldiers was
killed on the spot. This was more than the
military were likely to endure, and on receiving
orders they fired, and in the ensuing struggle four
of the rioters were killed and fifteen wounded.
This unhappy occurrence probably had its share
in the formation of that public opinion which in
1758 led to the passing of an Act of Parliament
for the regulation of the mills. This Act stated
that in consequence of the increase of population,
it was desirable to free the inhabitants of Manchester
from their obligation to grind at the
School Mills any corn or grain whatsoever, malt
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>only excepted. The exception was made on the
ground that the mills were adequate to the task of
grinding all the malt needed. The charge was
fixed at “one shilling and no more for the
grinding of one load containing six bushels or
twenty-four pecks of malt of Winchester measure,”
instead of the twenty-fourth part which had previously
been taken. The monopoly in this
modified form continued to our day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Formerly the privilege was valuable, and
though the profit was devoted to a good cause, it
is instructive to note the economical effect. The
restriction was always irksome to the brewers,
and it is observable that all modern local breweries
have been erected just outside the boundaries of
the township of Manchester, as, for instance, in
Moss Side, Hulme, Cheetham, Ardwick, and
Gorton. No new breweries have been built for
many years in Manchester proper.</p>

<p class='c004'>It will be seen from this rapid retrospect that
the Manchester Grammar School Mills have a
written history extending from the year 1301,
and a tradition that carries them generations
further back.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>The Rising of 1715.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>England, it has been epigramatically
said, is governed by reactions. There
is more truth in the remark than is usually found
in smart sayings. There is an ebb and flow in
the political tide, the waves which thunder against
the bulwarks and threaten to overwhelm the
peaceful town beyond them, fall calmly back
again to their sandy bed. An example of this
phenomenon we have in the intense Jacobitism
of Lancashire at the commencement of the last
century. Lancashire was not without gallant
cavaliers who charged for the “King and the
Laws” behind the fiery Rupert, but the county at
large swore by the Parliament and struck some
hard blows at the “Lord’s anointed.” The
memorable “petition for peace” was drawn up
by a Manchester man, and the first victims of
that civil war which was to drench England with
blood, were inhabitants of that town. It was
natural then to expect that the pendulum should
swing right to the other extreme of its line, and
that the descendants of those who had pulled
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>down the monarch from his throne, and consigned
him to the traitor’s block, should be sticklers
for the right divine of kings to govern wrong,
should risk fortune, life, and limb, to replace on
the throne of his ancestors the double dealing
James and his unfortunate descendants. There
were some special causes which strengthened the
hands of the Jacobites in this quarter. The
Roman Catholics were distinguishable by their
steady, unalterable loyalty to the House of Stuart,
and the persecution to which they were subjected
from the reign of Elizabeth downwards, only
served to strengthen their attachment. The
jealousy of the Low Church men, and the bitter
antagonism of the Puritans was sufficient to
defeat any amelioration of their condition which
the Sovereign might desire, but in their sufferings
they recollected that both Charles and his brother
had been desirous of extending to them toleration
for the exercise of their religion. The Dissenters,
however, chose to endure the severities of the
Test Act themselves, rather than do anything to
hinder the harrying and persecution of the
Romanists. The Roman Catholics had natural
friends in the High Church men, who held in all
fulness the doctrine of the divine right, and consequently
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>the unlawfulness of the tenure by which
King William and George I. held the throne.
The clearness and distinctness with which this
opinion was formulated must be considered if we
would understand the motive power of the
Jacobite rebellions.</p>

<p class='c004'>According to them the King was God’s
representative on earth, and unconditional obedience
was due to all his commands. He might be
a drunken, licentious scoundrel, a perjured villain,
a red-handed murderer, a raving madman, but
nothing on earth could invalidate his inborn
kingly right, and whoso disobeyed him, was false
to God and to his country. This opinion was
supported by a second theory as to the patriarchal
origin of monarchy. Adam and Abraham exercised
regal power, therefore it was “unnatural
for the people to govern or choose governors.”
Charles II. is but an odd looking patriarch,
although like the King of Yvetot, his subjects
had a hundred reasons for calling him their
father. However, as the learned O’Flaherty in
his “Ogygia” tells us that the Stuarts were
descended in a direct line from Adam (which is
probable), and that it was the 124th generation
that ascended the Scottish throne, Charles might
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>perhaps claim his monarchical privileges as heir
general of the Father of Mankind.</p>

<p class='c004'>This leading doctrine of the High Church party
was closely wedded to a sentiment of bitter
dislike of the Protestant Dissenters. The impeachment
of Sacheverell, the High Church
clergyman, for his denunciation of the revolution
of 1688, and of the principles which had brought
it about, roused to fever heat all the evil passions
of the time. His punishment (three years’ prohibition
from preaching) was so slight as to be
almost a triumph. In 1714 a bill for the repression
of Schism was only prevented from
coming in force by the death of Queen Anne.</p>

<p class='c004'>The accession of George I. was a tremendous
blow for the Jacobites, and in Manchester they
went mad with rage. The Pretender’s birthday,
Friday, the 10th of June, was fittingly selected as
the time for wreaking their revenge on the
Dissenters. On that day various places in
England were disgraced by riotous mobs drinking
health to King James, and breathing fiery vows
of vengeance against the Presbyterians. The
Manchester mob was second to none. The
town was in a state of anarchy for days, and King
Mob had it all his own way. With beating of
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>drums they enlivened their marches, and with
fiery potations inflamed their loyalty and piety.
Woe to the luckless Nonconformist who came
in their way! The riot was not unlike a rebellion.
They had their recognised leaders: a colonel,
whose name forgetful history has nowhere
recorded; and a captain, Thomas Syddal, a
sturdy blacksmith, the end of whose brawling life
was not far off. They had the tacit encouragement
of Jacobite magistrates, who left the rabble
masters of the situation. The only Dissenting
meeting-house in Manchester was in Acresfield,
and is now known as Cross Street Unitarian
Chapel. Headed by the valiant Syddal, these
friends of the ancient constitution in Church and
State attacked the humble meeting-house, and
wrecked it completely. The bare walls were all
the vestiges they left of the lowly house of prayer.
So fine a performance did the mob consider it,
that with infinite gusto they repeated it at Monton,
Blackley, and in fact all the meeting-houses that
fell in their way as they marched toward Yorkshire.
Things were assuming so serious an aspect, and
the local authorities were so unable or unwilling
to check it effectually, that the Government had
to interpose with a military force. It was not
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>until there had been a fortnight’s carnival of riot
and outrage that the Earl of Stair dispersed the
Manchester band, and took prisoners its leading
men. Occasional outbreaks in various places
continued until the end of July. The House of
Commons petitioned the King for the vigorous
enforcement of the law, the punishment of neglectful
justices, and the compensation from the public
funds of the sufferers. The destruction of religious
meeting-houses was declared to be felony without
benefit of clergy, and, £1,500 was granted to the
Protestant Dissenters of Manchester for the
repair of their temple.</p>

<p class='c004'>Syddal and his colonel were tried at Lancaster
Assizes in August. In pursuance of their sentence
they both decorated the pillory on the market day,
whilst some looked on with scorn and more with
sympathy. They were tenderly treated, for no
man was allowed to fling anything at them; thus
they escaped the worst part of the ordeal. From
the pillory back to jail, and there they lay until
their prison gates were opened by the army of
James III. The High Church faction were a
loose-living, hard-drinking race, fonder of confusing
their brains by drinking “Confusion to the Elector
of Hanover” than of striking home an honest blow
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>for the King over the water. Their conspiracies
were of the pot-house order, concocted over a
flowing punch-bowl. They exaggerated probably
even to themselves the strength of their party, and
when the Scottish Jacobites (with whom the
struggle was chiefly for the ancient integrity and
independence of their kingdom) determined to
raise the standard of the Pretender, they had
received assurances that twenty thousand Lancashire
men would join their forces. On the
faith of these promises the Fiery Cross was sent
flaming round the Highlands, and the rebellion,
which, if confined to Scotland, would have had
strong chances of success, was to be a general
one. The Earl of Derwentwater and the Roman
Catholic gentlemen of Northumberland effected a
junction with the two Scottish armies at Kelso.
This is not the place to chronicle the movements
of the rebel army, their want of purpose, or their
internal dissensions. The incompetence of their
leader, a country squire turned into a general,
whose jealousy of the military reputation of grim
old Brigadier Mackintosh led him to reject
wise counsel, brought on the fatal catastrophe
which awaited them. At Langholm they were
met by Lord Widdrington, who assured them of
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>Lancashire aid and sympathy, and this determined
at last their course of action. They marched into
England, but not without misgivings on the part
of the leaders, and many desertions on the part of
the Highlanders, who were bitterly opposed to
leaving Scotland. They were joined by very few
men in their English march, the leaders were
thoroughly dispirited, and Mackintosh, tough old
soldier as he was, looked gloomily at the cheerless
prospect before them.</p>

<p class='c004'>At Kendal their cheerfulness was somewhat
restored by the appearance of Lord Widdrington’s
brother with news that Lancashire was
ready to rise, that James III. had that day been
proclaimed King at Manchester, where the townspeople
had undertaken to furnish a troop of
fifty men at their own expense, and where
many volunteers might be expected. Instead
of marching on Newcastle, where the Whig
general was hurrying to meet them, they
determined to advance to Lancaster. The
loyalists were completely surprised at this descent
into Lancashire. Sir Henry Houghton was
at the head of a body of militia numbering 600.
He could not obtain the aid of some dragoons
who were stationed in Preston, but refused to
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>stir without orders from London, and he was
forced to retreat on Preston, and the army
of King James took peaceful possession of the
town with trumpets sounding, and the bare swords
of the gentlemen glittering gaily as they rode
triumphantly forward. The prisoners in the
castle were now released from durance vile,
and Syddal—Captain Syddal, as he was styled—attached
himself to the regiment of the Earl
of Derwentwater. Perhaps he was one of the
lucky gentlemen soldiers, who dressed “in their
best clothes,” went to drink a dish of tea with the
ladies of Lancaster, which fair Jacobites were also
“in their best rigging, and had their tea tables
richly furnished for to entertain their new suitors.”
On the 9th of November they marched to
Preston, and were greatly encouraged by learning
that the dragoons already mentioned had
quitted that town. Less pleasing to them was
the conduct of Peploe the curate, who had
the courage to read with extra emphasis and
unction the prayers for King George and his
family. At Preston the rebels remained inactive,
seemingly careless of the danger which threatened
them. Carpenter was hastening from Newcastle,
and a second force was hastening in detachments
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>from the west to be placed under the command of
General Wills in the neighbourhood. The plan
of the campaign was drawn up by no less a
man than Marlborough. On the 8th Wills
passed through Manchester and found the town
so disaffected that he quartered a thousand men
in it, greatly to the disgust of the High Church
Tories, some of whom were arrested, whilst others
fled, or remained in concealment. Whilst the
rebels were “feasting and courting” in Preston,
bewitched by the Jacobite charms of what was then
the most aristocratic and luxurious of the Lancashire
towns, wasting the precious hours in contented
lotos-eating, the Whigs were full of activity.
Even Dissenting ministers in more than one case
marched at the head of their congregations
with muskets, scythes mounted on poles, and
everything that could be tortured into weapons
of offence, and joined the army of General Wills
to fight for liberty and the Protestant succession.
The Rev. James Woods, of Chowbent, was
conspicuous in this way, and for the rest of
his life was commonly known as “General”
Woods.</p>

<p class='c004'>Notwithstanding the military genius of Mackintosh
who now planned the defence, the rebels
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>after some hard fighting, on the arrival of Carpenter
found themselves hopelessly surrounded.
They sent Colonel Oxburgh to treat with Wills
for a capitulation. “I will not treat with Rebels;
they have killed several of the King’s subjects,
and they must expect to undergo the same fate.”
Such was Wills’ alternative, unconditional surrender,
and only one hour in which to decide. This
secret negotiation exasperated the Highlanders,
who swore they would die fighting, and vowed
they would shoot their muddle-headed General
Forster if they had the chance. The time for
consideration was afterwards extended after a
further conference with some of the Scotch
officers, who pledged themselves to a cessation
from arms. Some six or seven rebels were, notwithstanding,
cut to pieces in an attempt to escape.
Mackintosh was now a hostage in the hands of
the King’s forces, and on the 13th of November
the defenders of Preston surrendered at discretion.
Many of the rebels escaped, but the number of
prisoners was 1,569.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rebellion begun hastily and ignorantly,
carried on through all its course with dissensions,
quarrels, and the most lamentable incompetence,
had arrived at its ignominious end, so far as
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>England was concerned. Preston was for some
time given up to plunder, and the prisoners
reserved for retribution, in divers jails of Lancashire
and Cheshire. The House of Hanover was
never noticeable for mercy, and the retribution
was a bloody one.</p>

<p class='c004'>The landing of James in Scotland did no good
at all. Above a thousand of the rebels were
transported, some of the leaders amongst them;
Forster and the brave old Mackintosh escaped,
the one by fraud, the other by force. The
number who were executed is not known. The
hangman had a triumphant progress through
Lancashire. On the eleventh of February, 1716,
there came into Manchester a melancholy cavalcade.
Bound to one horse by strong cords and surrounded
by guards, there rode into the town
dashing Tom Syddal, the former leader of the
High Church mob in destroying the Dissenting
chapels, and with him four others who had been
condemned to death. They were hanged, drawn,
and quartered, at Knott Mill. Syddal’s head
was afterwards fixed on the Market Cross.</p>

  <h2 class='c000'>The Fool of Lancaster.</h2>

<p class='c010'>“Take gifts with a sigh, most men give to be paid.”—<span class='sc'>J. B.
O’Reilly.</span> <cite>Rules of the Road.</cite></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>This story, which is told in “Jack of Dover,”
1604, is instructive if not amusing:—“There
was of late (quoth another of the jurie)
a ploughman and a butcher dwelling in Lancaster
who, for a trifling matter (like two fooles), went
to law, and spent much money therein, almost
to both their undoings; but at last, being both
consented to be tride by a lawyer dwelling in the
same town, each of them, in hope of a further
favour, bestowed gyftes upon him. The ploughman
first of all presented him a cupple of good
fat hens, desiring Mr. Lawyer to stand his good
friend, and to remember his suite in law, the which
he courteously tooke at his handes, saying that
what favour he could show him, he should be sure
of the uttermost. But now, when the butcher
heard of the presenting of these hens by the
ploughman, hee went and presently killed a
good fatte hogge, and in like manner presented it
to the lawyer, as a bribe to draw him to his side;
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>the which he also tooke very courteously, and
promised the like to him as he did before to the
other. But so it fell out, that shortly after the
verdict passed on the butcher’s side; which when
the ploughman had notice of, he came to the
lawyer, and asked him wherefore his two hens
were forgotten. Mary, quoth he, because there
came in a fatte hogge and eate them up. Now a
vengeance take that hog! quoth the ploughman,
that eate both my suit in law and hens together!
Well, quoth Jacke of Dover, this in my minde
was pretty foolery, but yet the foole of all fooles
is not heere found, that I looked for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This seems to have been a rather favourite
jest, for it is given also in the “Pleasant Conceits
of Old Hobson,” 1607, and in the “Mery Tales,”
1530, and is one of the mediæval jokes given by
Wright in his “Latin Stories” (Percy Society).</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c003'>Probably the first purely literary reference
to Manchester is that contained in the
first eclogue of Alexander Barclay. Of the two
shepherds who carry on a dialogue, Cornix is the
chief speaker, and graphically pourtrays the
miseries of life at court. Early in the conversation
comes this passage:—</p>

<div class='c005'>(<cite>Spenser Society’s Reprint</cite>, pp. 5-6.)</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>This passage has not escaped the notice either
of Mr. T. H. Jamieson, who has edited Barclay’s
translation of the “Stultifera Navis,” or of Dr.
A. W. Ward, who has written his life in the
“Dictionary of National Biography,” and puts
the query that Godmanchester may be meant.
The eclogue from which the quotation is taken,
together with two others, are said to be “gathered
out of a booke named in Latin, ‘Miseriæ
Curialium,’ compiled by Æneas Silvius, Poet and
Oratour.” This, of course, means that member of
the Piccolomini family, who, after an earlier life
not free from reproach, made a decorous pontiff,
as Pope Pius II., and died in 1464. This book,
drawn from his own experience of the unhappy
life of courtiers, was the most popular of all his
writings. It was often reprinted, but whether
Barclay worked from a printed or a MS. copy is
not known. Now, what his principles of translation
were we know, both from his declaration and
practice. In his version of Brandt’s “Ship of
Fools,” he tells how he added and omitted as
seemed best for his purpose of producing a book
that should aid in strengthening the morality of
the time. And in dealing with Æneas Sylvius,
he has been even freer than in dealing with
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>Brandt. Of the “Miseriæ Curialium,” there are
several editions in the British Museum, and
those of Paris (1475?), Cologne (1468?), Rome
(1485? and 1578), have been examined for
me by Dr. W. A. Shaw, to whom my best
thanks are due for his kindness. “The book,”
he says, “of Æneas Sylvius is in prose, and,
in epistolary form addressed to ‘dñō Johī de
Arch Pspicaci et claro Jurū cōsulto.’ There
is none of the eclogue and dialogue form of
Barclay’s work; there are no interlocutors, and
there are no references, save to such names of
classical antiquity as serve for satirical notice, in,
say, Juvenal, with the exception that, in the
section treating of the table and pleasures of eating,
he refers briefly to the place of origin of the
better known delicacies. There is no mention of
Manchester, nor of England, from first to last,
nor any possibility of it from the style of the
letter, and taking it casually, side by side with
Barclay, I cannot find a parallel point which
would suggest a translation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>We may, therefore, probably regard the
passage as strictly autobiographical, and conclude
that, in his wandering life as a preaching friar,
Barclay, at some time or other, visited Manchester.
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>From internal evidences, the eclogues
are assigned to the year 1514, but it is curious
that whilst there is a long reference to the death
of John Alcock, Bishop of Ely, in 1500, there is
none to his successors, Redmayne (1501) or
Stanley (1509). The early editions of the
eclogues are undated, and the first three eclogues
were apparently issued before the others. There
are many points of interest in regard to the
life and work of Alexander Barclay, which
cannot be discussed in directing attention to
one of the earliest—probably the very earliest—purely
literary mention of a place that in
after ages has not been without claims to
distinction in literature and science. The
date of Barclay’s birth is conjecturally, but
with tolerable certainty, fixed in 1476, and he
died in 1552. Since the biographies by Mr.
Jamieson and Dr. Ward were written, some fresh
information has appeared in Mr. James Gairdner’s
“Letters and Papers of the reign of Henry
VIII.,” vol. xiii., pt. 2 (1893). These show that
whilst Barclay was conscious of ecclesiastical
abuses and desirous of their reform, he was an
object of suspicion to those who were carrying out
the work of the suppression of the monasteries,
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>and ran some risk by his retention of the distinctive
habit of the friars. Robert Ward writes
on October 9th, 1538, to Cromwell that at
Barking, Suffolk, when Barclay preached there
in the Whitsun holidays, he did not declare
the King’s supremacy. Ward states that he
reproached the preacher for not doing so, but
does not record his answer. On October 12th,
William Dynham writes to Cromwell: “Of late
I came to the priory of St. Germayne in Cornwall,
and sat at supper with the Prior, accompanied by
Alexander Barckley, who the day before preached
in honour of the Blessed Virgin, but not so much
to the edifying of his audience as his demeanour
next day was, I heard, to their destruction. At
supper I moved such questions as I thought
might do good to the audience. He served my
purpose, till, ‘after a sodeyne dompe, he brake
silence, as a man that had spoken too well (and
yet a frere in a somewhat honester weed),’ and
glorified himself. He first protested he would
preach no new things, not set out by the King
and his Council. I answered, wondering what he
meant, when all men of literature and judgment
‘knew that our so Christian a Prince and his
Council set forth no new thing but the gospel of
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>Christ, and the sincere verity thereof.’ Barckley
replied, ‘I would to God that at the least the
laws of God might have as much authority as the
laws of the realm.’ Asked him what he meant,
and Barckley said, Nothing, but he thought men
were too busy pulling down images without
special commandment of the Prince. Dynham
answered, he knew none pulled down, except
such as idolatry was committed unto, and reminded
him ‘of St. Margarets Patent is rode’
(the rood of St. Margaret Pattens in London),
and the assembly, although somewhat dispraised,
yet for the intent and good fact thereof, tolerated.
Here, he demanded, what followed thereof? I
requiring him to answer his demand, he said I
knew how many tenements and some people were
burnt soon upon. ‘What, Barckley?’ said I,
‘here is somewhat moved; ye have a versatile
ingeyne, but were ye so sleper as an eel, here will
I hold you. Would you infect this audience with
that opinion, that God for such cause plagued
them? Your cankered heart is disclosed. My
true little stomach, with reverence of the prior
and his board, must be opened lest it break.
You are, Barckley, a false knave and a dissembling
frere. You get no pence might I rule
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>here. You seek your own profit vocall to hinder
the truth more than unity to set forth the true
and princely endeavour of our most Crysten, and
of his church Supremest Head, most laudable
enterprises; whereof, I trust, thou shalt hear.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>Writing to Cromwell on October 28th, Latimer
says that “A man has written to him that Frere
Bartlow does much hurt in ‘Corwall and in
Daynshyre,’ both with open preaching and private
communication. Suspects he has some comfort
from Rome, through Dr. Nycolasse.’ The Abbot
of Evesham, the bearer, asks Latimer to thank
Cromwell for him. Thinks he will find few who
will better remember his kindnesses. He seems
a very civil and honest man, and one who puts
all his trust in Cromwell. Requests Cromwell to
maintain him in his right to what he has obtained
by his goodness.” These passages enable Mr.
Gairdner to identify the subject of this anecdote
told by Foxe, the Martyrologist: “Hereunto also
pertaineth the example of Friar Bartley, who
wearing still his friar’s cowl after the suppression
of religious houses, Cromwell coming through
Paul’s Churchyard, and espying him in Rheines’s
shop. ‘Yea,’ said he, ‘will not that cowl of yours
be left off yet? And if I hear by one o’clock that
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>this apparel be not changed, thou shalt be hanged
immediately, for example to all others.’ And so,
putting his cowl away, he durst never wear it
after.” It is satisfactory to know that he survived
these dangers, received some preferment, and
died peaceably in 1552.</p>

<p class='c025'>“This volume contains thirty-seven sermons on old-fashioned hymns,
and when we say that each discourse averages about ten octavo pages,
printed in good-sized type, it will be seen that they are entitled to be called
short. The Rector of Ebchester is an adept at the production of short
sermons, and the line he has adopted in this instance is an extremely happy
one. It is a conception that appeals to a great multitude, and the hymns
which give the cue to the reflections form a large variety of well-known
spiritual songs, the favourites, indeed, in communities of every name.
Some of the sermons, indeed, most of them, have been prepared for
anniversaries and special occasions, and all are such as might be expected
from a man who is an undoubted lover of hymns. Their brevity excludes
prolixity, and terse summaries of facts, sharp statements of doctrine,
succinctness of argument, and directness of appeal characterise the whole.”—<cite>Newcastle
